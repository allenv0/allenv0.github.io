### Actions
- Success isn’t about luck — it’s about intentionality to increase your odds of success
- "Discovered” through doing, not predicted analytically in advance.


### Odds
- People who take action do not have “equal odds” with everyone else, so their expected upside is much higher than the average.
- Not all lottery tickets are equal. The best ones have capped downsides, and uncapped upsides. 
- The more good tickets you create, the higher your chances of winning.
- The direction in which you collect them is really important, and compounding leads to exponential outcomes.
