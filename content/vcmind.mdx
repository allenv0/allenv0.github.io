Having worked at a VC-backed startup and founded a few companies — plus with my partner working at a family office that’s an LP in many VC funds in Silicon Valley — I’ve had plenty of exposure to venture capitalists, both directly and through stories behind the scenes.

Let me tell you, fellow founders: <mark>very few of them are genuinely committed to a long-term vision or truly aligned with a startup’s values. Most are driven by hype and market trends, which often leads them to overgeneralize and make poor predictions.</mark>

So don’t blindly follow VC forecasts or market analyses — they’re often short-sighted. Instead, focus on building a business with real value, solid fundamentals, and a foundation that lasts.


### Things to keep in mind

- Most VCs are mediocre businesspeople with career-ladder mindsets.
- They celebrate raises, promotions, “30 Under 30” mentions, and Midas List appearances — but none of that determines whether your company will succeed.
- They crave “Grand Slam” returns but are mostly focused on their own careers — getting promoted to GP, raising a new fund, or landing a VP+ role at a big company before ever proving true returns.
- Most VCs are wrong most of the time — and more importantly, few have ever been hugely right.
- Many don’t have successful exits, yet they constantly tweet about “trends” and “insights” to attract deal flow and grow their network.
- They love writing memos about “Enduring Companies,” but are quick to sell their shares in the secondary market.
- Their public hype cycles — the constant trend tweets, fund announcements, and buzzwords — often exist just to raise the next fund, not because those markets are truly promising.
- Most will distance themselves once you’re no longer “the signal” for new deals or fundraising buzz.
- Their feedback cycles are longer than yours as a builder — they react slowly, often after the real opportunity has passed.
- Many prioritize short-term gains over sustainable growth, telling you to “grow at all costs” one year, then demanding profitability the next when the market shifts.
