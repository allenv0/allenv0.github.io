The firm's philosophy centers on maintaining a small, dedicated team to foster deepest connections and support for startups.\n\n---\n\n**GPs:**\n- Bill: Bill Gurley\n- Matt: Matt Choler\n- Peter: Peter Fenton\n- Mitch: Mitch Lasky\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/bc.webp)\n\n---\n\n## Table of Content\n- [Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n- [How Benchmark Operates](#how-benchmark-operates)\n  - [Fund Style](#fund-style)\n  - [Staying Small](#staying-small)\n  - [Being VC is harder than before](#being-vc-is-harder-than-before)\n  - [On looking for in a partner](#on-looking-for-in-a-partner)\n  - [Operator vs VC](#operator-vs-vc)\n  - [Predict Future vs. Present](#predict-future-vs-present)\n  - [Growth](#growth)\n- [On looking for in an entrepreneur](#on-looking-for-in-an-entrepreneur)\n- [Staying Humble](#staying-humble)\n- [Enterprise vs. Consumer](#enterprise-vs-consumer)\n- [Downturn](#downturn)\n- [Side Notes](#side-notes)\n  - [Instagram](#instagram)\n  - [Uber](#uber)\n- [Sources](#sources)\n\n---\n\n## How Benchmark Operates\n\n### Fund Style\n\n**Bill**\n\nOur job, as early-stage venture capitalists, does not scale. It is defined by service to entrepreneurs and the teams they build, helping them to realize their vision and the potential of their companies. Whether it is recruiting a key executive, making a strategic decision, or taking a company public, productive and honest dialog between a CEO and a board member can contribute considerably to outcomes. While many venture firms have adopted a stage-agnostic approach, or have hired junior or role-defined staff to help source and support their investments, Benchmark continues to focus on and take pride in the craft of early-stage venture investing.\n\nBenchmark’s goal is to avoid the generational struggles that have hobbled other Valley firms: Young people end up the hustlers and the old people sit in place. That’s the biggest secret of Benchmark. When our founders were at the peak of their powers, they handed us the keys.\n\n\n**Matt**\n\nVenture investing work is really hard if you aspire to do it well. My partners and I wake up every day being fully aware that the present and future define success in the startup world, that it's a ground war not an air war, and we just go do our best to do the work every single day. We focus on just one thing - working with extraordinary entrepreneurs through early-stage venture investing in software companies, from infrastructure to mobile apps, mostly in San Francisco/Silicon Valley - and we keep our fund size and our team small.\n\nWe're a small team with a singular focus and we prefer to spend our time and energy looking for great startups and working shoulder-to-shoulder with extraordinary entrepreneurs to help them fulfill their companies' potential. We believe that venture capital is a high-touch, highly personal, sub-scale service business, and our ambition and aspiration is to help you scale your business, not to use your business to scale our own.\n\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/office.png)\n\n**Fenton**\n\nI think there has been, probably for the first time … I have been in this business for 15 years (2014), like Bill, where strategy is starting to show up and create a different approach and style. It used to be that firms were just made up of different personality types, but they basically had the same strategy, which was to raise some money, put it to work over a period of three to four years and do your best. Benchmark, I think, has a very explicit strategy, which we’ve been open about: Our belief that this is more of a guild than a corporation. So, we try to think of it as artisans practicing a craft.\n\nThat particular strategy, which we’re defined by, because we love the day-to-day work with the entrepreneurs, prevents us from scaling. We don’t have an ability to offload any part of our relationship in the way we practice it, to anyone other than ourselves. So, there’s no associates, no principals, there is really nothing beyond the group of people here and our assistants who keep our lives sane. That’s a strategy.\n\nAnother perfectly cogent strategy is to try and build a certain set of services that you use to differentiate. That requires a set of skills and talents that for whatever reason, because we lack the capacity to do it or the abilities or the desire, it’s not how we choose to practice the business. And so I think it’s fun, because we don’t say this to be glib — we have tremendous respect for our peers — I think an environment that gets more competitive is better for everybody. It forces us to be more differentiated and explicit about what we do and it’s better for the entrepreneur as it obviously increases available services and choice.\n\n**Gurley**\n\nThere has been this fundamental difference that’s always been different at Benchmark around the equal partnership model. I think other firms try and talk to it as they kind of need to recruit. But I don’t think they actually live it and I don’t think their economics are structured that way. But, to what Peter said, there are some amazing venture capital firms that don’t choose that model.\n\n\n**Fenton**\n\nI think generational change is one of the hardest things in a venture capital firm, and it’s one of the few things they actually spend time working on: Making phone calls, doing due diligence — it’s the predominant question you get from a limited partner.\n\nThere’s a sublimation of someone’s ego that has to occur to be able to effect generational change. So, the historical narrative is: A partner ages, they get more economics and, as the younger person comes in and produces, the older partners take an unfair share of the economics from the younger partner’s perspective. Well, the older partner says, “I gave you the platform, I gave you the training, I’m getting my just desserts.”\n\n<mark>By creating an equal partnership model, what Benchmark is saying is, “You’re all in or you’re all out.” And I think that idea of a binary state requires you to say, as our partners have, “We are willing to give the franchise to the people on the field 24/7.”</mark>\n\n**Lasky**\n\nIt also catalyzes that intergenerational change, because <mark>it requires you to raise your hand and say, “I’m not going to be able to be all in on the next one,”</mark> and then, therefore, it forces those hard decisions, where in other firms, maybe those hard decisions get kicked down the road.\n\n**Gurley**\n\nI think the model also allows you to go out and get people like Matt Cohler that would be tough to recruit into a starting position at a firm.\n\n**Fenton**\n\nI think it’s always easy to look at prior success as an indicator of the future. But the problem with venture is that <mark>we are at the best of our job seven to 15 years in, so what matters the most is that young people are coming into the firm, learning the business and they are going to be peaking when they are still hyper-relevant.</mark>\n\nNot to toot our own horn, but you look at Matt and being super relevant in your mid-30s and having five-plus years of venture investing is the dream scenario. The instincts of that is what made Snapchat work, or when Matt took an Uber ride in San Francisco, he said, “We’re going to invest in this company.” So, you have to be so engaged with the phenomenon on a primary level, versus when you’re older, you can abstract things away, like saying “I can’t make sense of that Snapchat thing” is something you would have heard from an older generation.\n\n\n**Cohler**\n\nI think it is really just about <mark>being curious. I think in some ways, the youngest person in our partnership is Mitch, actually, because he’s a hacker.</mark> Mitch literally is on top of many things like the infrastructure technologies we look at and invest in well in advance of them ever contemplating venture rounds, in some cases in advance of them even becoming companies, as a user.\n\nI think one of the things that works really well for us as such a small partnership is just being able to bring everybody’s distinct personalities. I think like a lot of good partnerships, we have a lot of individual attributes amongst us and also a lot of shared values at the core, and being able to pull all that in at any opportunity is really helpful.\n\n\nI think our shared value is around how we see what makes sense for us to practice this business. Which is, as Peter and Bill talked about, that world view that for us, we don’t aspire to scale. It’s something that we view as a very hands-on, feet-on-the-street, ground work, every day, always pushing, working alongside the entrepreneurs sort of artisan business, as opposed to a corporation. Again, there’s more than one way to do it, it’s just those are the values that resonate with us.\n\n**Lasky**\n\nI’d add to that, because this is really subtle and it’s really hard to pull off inside these organizations, it’s being incredibly competitive, but not with each other. It’s very difficult to pull off, since when you have someone who’s hyper-competitive, they don’t have a boundary. We’re super cooperative internally and hyper-competitive externally.\n\nCohler: That requires a sublimation of individual egos.\n\n**Fenton**\n\nWell, we’re all deeply flawed too. In different ways. Complementary flaws is one of the shared values.\n\nWe underestimate the value of just spending time together. The firm when I joined, it was six and it grew to seven partners, you feel entropy when you get to a certain level. And so, we have come down to the current team, every Monday we do a dinner and invite a guest of some sort. And there is something about the idea that we respect each other as investors and admire each other as friends and partners.\n\nIn most firms, you can get one of those things — there’s a lot of admiration, but no respect, or respect, but you never want to get in the same room as the person. Nine out of 10 partnerships I see are set up so the internal competition makes it hard to view your partner as a true peer because you always want to know: Am I doing better or worse?\n\n\n\n### Staying Small\n\n**Cohler**\n\nWe try to stay pretty focused and pretty clear in our approach and, again, we’re trying not to scale and we’re really selective about which entrepreneurs and companies we back, so we keep the fund small and that makes it less difficult to raise a fund than would be the case, all things being equal, if you were trying to raise a $1 billion fund. And we’re very fortunate that we’ve got very supportive LPs.\n\n\n**Gurley:**\n\nMy belief is that starting with 2008 — I mean, what happened in 1999 and 2001 starts to play a role — but it was really 2008 where all the LPs kind of woke up and said, “You know, enough is enough.” For firms that invest in Series A and B, it’s become, I think, hard, and I think it’s become harder to raise funds in that sector. For various reasons, the seed stage — just because more wealth has been created in the past three or four years, so there is ample cash there. And then, for reasons that are still quite curious to me, the late-stage market has just been full of money … but we’ve got a small set of LPs that we’ve been with forever, and it’s not a process, really.\n\n\n**Cohler:**\n\nAnd we have a very focused strategy. We don’t have a seed fund, we don’t have a growth fund, we don’t have international funds, we don’t have sector funds. We have one early-stage, company-building Internet investing fund, and that makes sense.\n\nBenchmark is very much open for business and my partners and I are meeting with entrepreneurs about Series A investments every single day. The Series A market is the most durable and consistent part of the post-angel fundraising cycle because it represents the point at which an idea or an MVP product turns into a true company and starts to incur people costs. Series A financings are usually mostly about those people costs, the costs of salary and benefits and office space required to build a small and growing team, and those sorts of costs per unit don't change by orders of magnitude over time in the same way that other technology costs can. Series A valuations and team salaries go up and down cyclically but only to a small degree.\n\nEntrepreneurs and investors should always be thinking about this round of funding in terms of the next round of funding, so the bigger question is what's going on with Series B and beyond. That's a topic for another question, but for now suffice it to say that we've been living in an unprecedented environment over the past several years where the cost of capital has been meaningfully lower for \"late-stage private\" companies than for equivalent public companies. This has led to all kinds of locally rational but global strange behavior, as has been much discussed lately. This was never going to be scalable as a phenomenon simply because the scale and liquidity of capital available in public markets is so much greater than in private ones.\n\n**Gurley:**\n\nWe got distracted from our focus in early 2000, and it took away from what we loved to do. So our resolve is partially a function of the fact that we lived through that, so we think long and hard before we do something that would expand the scope of what we’re doing, just mainly because it distracts you.\n\n\n### Being VC is harder than before\n\n\n**Peter:**\n\nOn a relative basis, the venture capitalist business today is harder than what it was, earlier in my career. It is a business that is defined by shoe-leather, hustle, energy and intensity. <mark>It is one of those few careers where the older you get; your probability of success goes down.</mark> So, after two decades (2023) in the venture capital business, you are less likely to find the next Google or Facebook. There are number of possible reasons for that. Success, in a venture business, can imprison you in your current board commitments. Second, success can lead you to believe wrongly that you have some special divine gifts of being able to make the companies you invest in successful. The reality is that you play a small part.\n\nThird, as you are successful, you have an image that great entrepreneurs will come and find you, which is just not the case; you need to go find them. That energy and motivation to be outbound is something that success can work against because your calendar is filled with people who want to meet you rather than people you should be trying to find.\n\nSuccess creates diversions and distractions that take you off the core discipline. Business, in itself, is an activity contest. It is about the number of hours you invest along with intensity and hustle that you put into it. The minute you back off, you degrade quickly. If you are not passionate about your job, you won’t sustain in this career.\n\n\n\n### On looking for in a partner\n\n**Fenton**\n\nI think it starts with this very basic question. I ask my partners this question every few months: <mark>We're founding a new firm. How do we go hire? And that's a very different question than who do we want to add to Benchmark.</mark>\n\nAnd so when you think of it from that primitive state of refounding, and I think Benchmark has been founded a few times, I think some companies say this to try and convince people that they're, You don't have to be a founder, you can come be a founder here. I actually think that's true here, because the culture, while it carries that through line of attracting a certain kind of person who wants to be in a non hierarchical structure, who wants a firm that amplifies their strengths, and that buttresses their weaknesses. Like we speak to a certain kind of investor. But if we start with that question, and that's how I've thought about it with the people we brought on, which is <mark>if I were leaving Benchmark to start the next Benchmark, would I hire this person?Would I want to convince them to cofound with me, because in a sense, I'm not hiring them. And it's a weird conversation, which is why I think we can recruit some great people, is that we're not really hiring them. We're asking them to found the next version of whatever this is that we have.</mark>\n\nIt's not like a band, where you say, Here is Neil Young with a new lineup.And I think that's kind of fun, because it is a anti-hierarchical, anti-legacy, anti-permanence theory, which is that everything is ephemeral. And every firm is ephemeral in the totality of existence. We're just this little blip in getting us more in touch with that finitude of this Benchmark, this Benchmark will be gone in three to five years. There'll be a new group. Not entirely, but certain people, myself included, we're finite. So I come to that question of like, who wants to refound?\n\nAnd then there's other layers on top of that, which is, what's not represented in the group that's part of the firm we want to found? And it could be experience base, it could be personality type, it could be... but it's far less quantitative than it is qualitative. So I think one of the things we'd like to add to the firm going forward, Eric, having been a failed CEO--successful CEO, actually, because he sold the company, and he says failed, but he's not exactly right. I think having people who are around the table that have had more recent and relevant direct experience, building a startup will be great for the firm. And we're gonna add that.\n\nAnd it's not that we can't do our job without it, and we're not defined by having experienced, we're defined by the quality of people, the questions we ask. But it's a nice thing to have in the room. Eric represents it, Sarah was at Pinterest for a long time, I think saw that. But we want to add more of that. So you tune it against that sort of core note of founder-level quality, which means they have to share culturally, this sort of sense of they're serving entrepreneurs, they don't want their name on the website. They don't seek opportunities for a go at self expression. Because no question you could rationalize it. Well, if you're doing that, it's because you can draw attention to the companies. Yeah, maybe. There's always some way to think about everything and analyte this kind to yourself. But that's where we are. And I think we have an average age, right now, in the late 30s. It's an interesting thing to think about. If we hadn't done the work of the founders all firing themselves, our average age would be mid 50s--actually it's not true, it would be early 60s, even with the current partners. And so the fact that we continue to rejuvenate and keep it in that essential core is I think, really, to me, the model propagates that way, because it's destroying itself constantly.\n\n### Operator vs VC\n\n**Matt:**\n\nVenture investing and operating roles are both ultimately about enabling companies to achieve their goals and reach their full potential, but the specific goals and specific skills required to achieve those goals are different. Depending on what sort of operating role and context you've been in, you may or may not find venture investing work to be right for you.\n\nThe key goals and the key skills in venture are:\n\nSurfacing potential new early-stage investments. This takes extreme curiosity, a strong living network of relationships across an ecosystem, the desire to be operating at the ground level all the time, and the hustle to keep doing it\n\nDeveloping a clear point of view on the potential of a startup: the entrepreneur, the product and business, and possible impact and durability of the company. This takes specific types of judgment - judgment on entrepreneurial talent, on product and business models, and on the potential impact those specific forces could have on a specific market\nWinning the opportunity to invest in and work with great startups. The best startup venture funding rounds are almost always highly competitive, and winning the right to invest takes the ability to be persuasive in the right ways\n\nHelping the company to achieve its full potential through team-building, future rounds of financing (up to and beyond an IPO) and strategic focus. This too is about persuasion in and about influencing key decisions (hopefully well!) without having control\n\nSome of these skills are also important in an operating role, but not all of them are - and just as importantly, some of the key skills required in an operating role can be unimportant or even counter-productive in venture. In particular, venture is not about having direct control over operating decisions such as setting and owning near-term operational goals and managing people and teams directly. Former CEOs in particular sometimes struggle with transitioning to a venture role where they're not directly in charge.\n\nBeing able to advise entrepreneurs on operational issues and decisions as a venture investor can certainly be valuable, but entrepreneurs shouldn't be picking their venture investors on the basis of how good those investors are at operating, they should be picking their venture investors on the basis of how good they are at venture investment work. There's a reason why many of the greatest venture investors of all time didn't have senior careers as operators prior to going into venture - Mike Moritz, Fred Wilson, John Doerr and my partners Bill Gurley and Peter Fenton all come to mind.\n\n\n---\n- [Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n- [How Benchmark Operates](#how-benchmark-operates)\n  - [Fund Style](#fund-style)\n  - [Staying Small](#staying-small)\n  - [Being VC is harder than before](#being-vc-is-harder-than-before)\n  - [On looking for in a partner](#on-looking-for-in-a-partner)\n  - [Operator vs VC](#operator-vs-vc)\n  - [Predict Future vs. Present](#predict-future-vs-present)\n  - [Growth](#growth)\n- [On looking for in an entrepreneur](#on-looking-for-in-an-entrepreneur)\n- [Staying Humble](#staying-humble)\n- [Enterprise vs. Consumer](#enterprise-vs-consumer)\n- [Downturn](#downturn)\n- [Side Notes](#side-notes)\n  - [Instagram](#instagram)\n  - [Uber](#uber)\n- [Sources](#sources)\n---\n\n\n### Predict Future vs. Present\n\n\n**Matt**\n\nFirst of all I should clarify that when I talked about noticing the present first, I meant it in the context of surfacing and pursuing new investment opportunities. <mark>Once a venture investor is actually working with a company it's critically important for that person to be able to see around corners–not to predict the future many years out</mark>, but to have the experience, pattern-recognition and judgment to know what's coming next and to help an entrepreneur and company make good decisions by making use of that knowledge.\n\nThat said, there are lots of interesting things going on right now. Three that are top-of-mind for me and my partners are the fundraising and capital markets environment, the maturing of the mobile ecosystem, and the increasing startup activity in areas that seem like they may turn out to be better opportunities for big companies than for new ones, such as AI and machine learning where a massive amount of data and compute is required to make something work.\n\n\n**Peter**:\n\nAt Accel I was taught, ‘we need to have a prepared mind’ at really thinking about a segment, a category, and its coherence. So I came to Benchmark and I didn't know if I agreed with that. And my partner said, \"don't you do that shit here.\" Throw that crystal ball out, you can't predict anything. What you can do is recognize when lightning strikes.\n\nI don't invest in trends. I know it sounds a bit too-cool-for-school but what I've found is that <mark>you get far more insight from purpose than from trends</mark>. So, for example, in the case of Docker I invested in Dotcloud (which became Docker), in the purpose of this radical, intense leader, Solomon, who wanted to give the world's programmers superpowers, tools of mass innovation. In the case of Yelp, it was Jeremy's purpose to allow for the truth of great (and bad) local businesses to be visible to all. Or when I met Jack in 2007, he had this unstoppable purpose for Twitter to “bring you closer”. Sometimes that purpose is just this raw force, an energy, like it was in the case of Shay at Elastic in 2012. When I feel like the trend, the space, the concepts vs the tactile reality of a purpose forms the narrative of the investment I lose all interest.\n\nAnother way to look at this is that I've found the best entrepreneurs have <mark>discovered preconditions that enable their purpose</mark>, that make it possible today versus in 10 years. To increase the odds of finding the extraordinary, it helps to have a point of view about the most dynamic preconditions. As my partner Matt Cohler says, “to see the present most clearly”. Obviously mobile ubiquity is the major precondition today, with the additional attributes of GPS, high quality cameras, and ever improving networks. I don't think we've even started to realize the potential of this enhanced mobile ubiquity. Another precondition is social behavioral norms, our readiness to share, to engage expands in what feels like a geometric way when the conditions are right. An “all cloud” world is another precondition — it forces every layer of the technology stack to be reconsidered and in many cases reinvented for the cloud. Mass compute and mass storage is a precondition for machine learning at scale.\n\nI wish it were easy to articulate, but it isn’t because in some ways venture capital is all about finding the exceptions - there are no set of rules you can consistently apply.\n\nThe great market, great team stuff is obvious and uninteresting but there may be some nuances to those points that are valuable to think about.\n\nOn the market - <mark>I find myself getting most excited when the founders articulate a point of view on the market or problem that I haven’t heard or read before, and forces me to challenge my own assumptions.</mark>\n\nFor example, 4.5 years ago, when I first met\xa0Jay Krepsand\xa0Neha Narkhede, co-founders of Confluent, they explained why Kafka wasn’t just a pipeline for data ingest, but actually the beginnings of a much larger, up-until-then-unarticulated idea - a real-time analog to the data warehouse. They made me change my world view. It was like they told me a secret that very few people knew, but in time would become common knowledge. Thinking about it now, every single company I’ve invested in has a similar story.\n\nAlso on the market - a lesson I learned the hard way is <mark>it is much easier if there is something massively changing in the world that creates a tailwind for the startup (or the category).</mark> For example, Instagram took advantage of phones with cameras everywhere, and a couple years later, Snapchat took advantage of phones with cameras` AND LTE everywhere. I don’t believe the timing of those successes is coincidental. That doesn’t mean a particular startup doesn’t have to beat the other companies in the category, but it does often mean the category will yield a big winner.\n\nOn the team - I like teams that have been thinking about the very problem they are going after for a really really long time. There are lots of blog posts articulating this in various ways - Chris Dixon’s idea maze concept or the notion of founder-market fit come to mind.\n\nIn enterprise some old-school VCs often invest in incredible technology founding teams with the intention of hiring a go-to-market oriented CEO in a couple years. <mark>Personally I much prefer founding teams with CEOs who have a deep understanding of the problem/technology/product AND great go-to-market instincts and strong desire to learn and develop those instincts.</mark> They are rare, but having all that in one head pays dividends for years and years.\n\nThere are lots of other things that matter too - moats and network effects, personal chemistry with the founders, my personal interest and knowledge of the space…\n\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/fenton.png)\n\n\n- Houseparty was shut down by Epic (2021)\n- Sketch lost the battle to Figma (2022)\n\n\n**Bill:**\n\nBusinesses are complex adaptive systems that cannot be modeled with certainty.\n\nThe past can be a poor guide for the future if the future offering is materially different than the past. Let’s first dive into the TAM assumption. In choosing to use the historical size of the taxi and limousine market, Damodaran is making an implicit assumption that the future will look quite like the past. In other words, the arrival of a product or service like Uber will have zero impact on the overall market size of the car-for-hire transportation market. There are multiple reasons why this is a flawed assumption.\n\nWhen you materially improve an offering, and create new features, functions, experiences, price points, and even enable new use cases, you can materially expand the market in the process.\n\n### Growth\n\n**Matt**\n\n*Strategies for early growth at LinkedIn and Facebook*\n\nThe early growth patterns at LinkedIn and Facebook were very different, even though the goal was the same as for every network-effect or marketplace startup: go from nothing to something which gets better and better as it gets bigger, by tipping into liquidity. All of the great network-effect and marketplace companies I've had the privilege to be involved with have solved this problem, from LinkedIn and Facebook to Instagram, Uber, Snapchat, ResearchGate, Twitter and Tinder. The means to the end have changed over time as the underlying platforms and distribution channels have changed, but the goal is always the same.\n\nGetting to liquidity in a network or marketplace always starts with getting past a classic chicken-and-egg problem: a marketplace or network is only valuable once there are lots of people there, so how do you get people to participate before there are lots of people there? Having a small initial surface area where you're trying to tip a network or marketplace into liquidity always makes this easier: when there are fewer people you need to entice to participate in order to reach a tipping point, the odds of getting a large enough % of those people to do so go way up. And importantly, you can get to that liquidity more quickly when you're starting with a small surface area. Time is a really important and often-overlooked aspect of network growth - if a network takes too long to tip then you can end up in the self-fulfilling vicious circle of a long bad party.\n\nAt Thefacebook we started with American undergraduate schools. These all have the huge benefit of being small, clearly defined spaces, which made it possible for us to tip each one of them very quickly. In many cases it was literally a matter of hours from the time we opened a new school to the time when most people in that school were using the product actively. The specific things we had to do to make this work over and over again were deciding which schools to prioritize opening when; doing a lot of (unpaid!) offline and grassroots local guerrilla marketing; and collecting and bottling-up demand from schools we weren't ready to launch yet then unleashing all of that pent-up demand at once when we were ready to launch a new school. Initially each school was its own island, and then once we had enough schools we started to link the schools together which lead to network effects both within and across schools. It's worth noting that these early chapters at Facebook involved very little true \"viral marketing\" or \"growth hacking\" and the early growth at Thefacebook was more linear than exponential as a function of the limitations on who could sign up. I remember being surprised to see how few typical viral mechanisms were built into the product when I first started exploring it in 2004, even by the standards of that time. But those limitations on who could sign up and use Thefacebook were crucial to the core utility of the product for its early users, drove unprecedented engagement numbers, and set a fantastic foundation for the future.\n\nAt LinkedIn we didn't have the benefit of a small, clearly-defined initial surface area to go after at the start given the way the product has always worked, so we had to resort to - and in several cases invent - viral mechanisms for growth. In 2003 when LinkedIn launched (many people don't realize that LinkedIn launched almost a year before Thefacebook!) the two primary distribution channels available to us were web search and email. LinkedIn profiles and content weren't showing up meaningfully in search results so we couldn't make much use of SEO. This was because we were very concerned about user privacy and control - in 2003 LinkedIn was actually the first service of any real size where people were putting their full first and last name on a user-generated profile online, and there were originally no pictures on user profiles by design. So email virality was the primary channel available to us for distribution. Like with all exponential functions there was a long initial tail on this viral growth, and Thefacebook actually reached 1,000,000 users much faster than LinkedIn despite not having virality engineered into the product. But once LinkedIn did tip it went from being a curiosity to a service with profound utility. It required a visionary entrepreneur, patient investors, and a team willing to run lots of scrappy experiments to get there.\n\nSEO and email are still both good tools for distribution and growth today, but as the platform has shifted to mobile other things have become at least as important. There's no unpaid mobile distribution platform which is as low-friction and easy as the SEO, email, the MySpace platform (through which YouTube grew) and the Facebook platform (through which Instagram and Pinterest grew) channels were in the Web 2.0 era. If anything this has raised the bar on the importance of finding a way to tip quickly into small networks or marketplaces then expand from there. Uber and Snapchat are both great examples of this: Uber started by focusing on black cars in San Francisco, making that market tip on both the demand and supply side, then launching additional city-level marketplaces from there; Snapchat started with a product that was immediately useful for people using it in a \"network\" of as few as 2 (or arguably even 1) person thanks to its initial focus on a new form of private communication and private sharing, and grew from there.\n\n\n## On looking for in an entrepreneur\n\n**Mitch:**\n\nMy partner Bill Gurley has said that in venture it’s not enough to be “consensus correct” — that’s essentially an index fund and won’t outperform the baseline market — you have to be non-consensus correct. If you really want to create “alpha” as a venture investor, you have to be willing to entertain a bit of crazy.\n\nThe “crazy good” ideas usually come down to three important factors.\n\n\n1. <mark>Is there an untapped market or unmet need that the idea connects with in an organic way, and can you show evidence of momentum?</mark>\n2. Is the idea suitable to sustain a business? Venture capitalists invest in companies, not products or feature improvements. Companies have to be able to make money, and great companies have to be able to make lots of money, ideally with defensible moats, economies of scale, and network effects.\n3. <mark>Can the founders organize a team to execute the idea in a really great product or service?</mark> Ideas are worthless without proper execution.\n\n\n**Peter:**\n\nI asked this question to Paul Graham, who runs Y Combinator, and was struck by the resonance of his answer with mine. <mark>The first quality in any entrepreneur, which is visible in the first 90 seconds, is authenticity.</mark> You need to have a solid foundation and confidence in what you are doing. Majority of entrepreneurs we meet are unfortunately promotional. It’s a gut feel and I felt it, for example, with Travis at Uber or Evan at Snapchat. These are great examples.\n\nIf you met Evan, at age 21, the intensity of his belief in what he was building was captivating. Secondly, I think the trait that great entrepreneurs have is fearlessness or fearsomeness. There needs to be something crazy in terms of recklessness, intensity and irreverence. Paul describes it as fearsomeness because he says that he needs to feel nervous about this person. A lot of great founders are dropouts. They don’t necessarily want to get grades in a system, which they didn’t create. Getting good grades in a system that you didn’t create can become more embarrassing because your subject is somebody else’s domain.\n\nThe third trait is a mindset that I look for in an entrepreneur — a <mark>learn-it-all, and not a know-it-all</mark>, approach. I think it is a remarkable trait that is common between the very best people, be it Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey or Evan Spiegel. They are effective critical thinkers; they are constantly asking questions and listening to those. That drives their long-term success. As a potential investor, I find them interrogating me as much as I am interrogating them. Without being offensive, they will ask me questions like ‘What is it about our business that you like?’ or ‘Tell me why you think that is interesting?’ Beyond this, there comes a personality trait. I have been doing this job for 19 years and I ask this basic question ‘Would I want to work for that person?’ A lot of what we are doing is recruiting. There are a lot of people who tick the first two boxes of authenticity and fearsomeness, but for the lack of choice of words, I would say I find them unappealing to work with. We were lucky to spend time with Jeff Bezos, who is a big investor in our fund. As part of that, we get a dinner with him every year. Of course, there is a survivor bias, but these dimensions are crystal clear in great entrepreneurs like him.\n\n\n**Matt:**\n\nAn entrepreneur with vision, the ability to tell a compelling story, and the ability to recruit fantastic operating execs; and a product and business model with the potential to drive a sharp wedge through a market, reshape and grow that market, and command a durable leadership position in it. <mark>Network-effect and marketplace models (as seen in companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, Snapchat, ResearchGate, Instagram, Twitter and Tinder) are not the only ways to do this, but they're the ones I understand the best and believe in the most.</mark>\n\nMajor red flags in an investment:\n\n- Generating demand primarily through direct paid marketing. Users and customers acquired through direct-response advertising tend to be of lower quality than those acquired organically, and acquiring this way gets harder and more competitive as you get bigger - not a great foundation, and from an investment perspective, not great evidence that you're creating something people deeply want\n- Having no competitors. There are exceptions but most of the time no competition means no opportunity. Most people don't realize that Thefacebook, LinkedIn and Instagram all had lots of now-forgotten competitors in their early years. - Having a huge incumbent addressable market. This might sound counterintuitive, but when you're trying to build something new or disruptive within a huge existing market it can be much harder to get into a position of leverage and leadership than if you start with a smaller market and grow or reshape it over time. Thefacebook/Facebook, Uber and even Google (in terms of the web search advertising market) are all great examples of this\n\n\n## Staying Humble\n\n**Peter:**\n\nI think it's a confluence of variables that the best you can do is be conscious of them, because then you have a chance to transcend them. The first is ego. And the great next company is likely to be started by somebody that's totally unknown. And they don't know that you did these things 10 years ago, or that you're this or that, and maybe they can find you online and have some... but the probability that they're going to reach out to you is really low. So if you let your ego develop, then you start to assume great people will come find you. But they don't. Typically, and I think this is the true, and the super majority of cases for us, we call them cold.\n\nAnd it's hard if you think you're successful, to do something that you were doing when you were 26. The same cold call: Hey, I'm Logan, and you don't know who I am but...so ego gives you a set of assumptions about what's going to come your way that are typically wrong. And as a double negative, though, <mark>because you then get the opportunities of people who want to talk to famous people, or well known people, and so you have a flow of opportunities, either from your historical investments that are historical--and that that can be great, by the way, but it's on average, you build more of a perturbation in the signals from that fresh question of what's the most interesting new thing right now.</mark>\n\nAnd so the trappings of success, and ego is a facet of that, the aging of the network... And I think there are other pathologies that people experience. And one of them is just the nature of wealth, and how that tends to impact--it happens with entrepreneurs too--the hours in the day. So you map the 24 hours that you spend when you're at the beginning of your venture career versus the middle versus the end. And there's a pretty profound shift for many people. One of the things I'm struggling with, I always struggle with, is making enough time to go find that next great young entrepreneur—\n\nI'm on 12 boards. So I still do it. And I have to rely more on the instincts now that I have on the person than I do on due diligence or meeting all 10 companies that are in this area. And so that puts me at risk. I'm more likely to commit quickly, and decisively. And I'm committing for 10 years. These are all conflating factors. <mark>One of the dimensions I think you have more control over than you know, is mental agility and freshness. If you assume that there's a requirement of equality of curiosity, and you take that as a ground condition of being a Benchmark partner, and I certainly do, then I have to be just as wildly curious as I was when I was 26, or 32, or 42.</mark>> And I find that for some people that ages, and it fatigues, and they get a little bit more, Well, let me tell you about my... you sit in a board meeting, you get to hear about: I've been doing this for X number of years, and you're like Ugh. Like, I want to be part of the team that destroys that generation.\n\nSo in a sense, I want to destroy my prior self through the creative process, the curious process of discovering what's violent and new and interesting. I'll give a good example that. For a long time, AI was not a good place to invest. In fact, a honeypot for a particularly bad kind of investor that didn't understand that economic value is not created in science, per se, it is created in the construct of a company and a product, and value capture and value creation aren't the same thing. And <mark>if you wanted to make money in ML, you needed to build the vertical product.</mark> And so ML was sort of the icing on the cake. And if you just looked at the icing, you wouldn't see the cake. That's shifting quickly. And the perturbations, the violence, and the pace of movement in ML and AI requires you to come at it fresh as if you'd never been an investor and say, Okay, imagine this thing's happening, where we're able to look at a whole ecosystem being lit up, where historically you would have been killed if you wanted to invest in it. Now, it may be THE thing to be investing in.\n\nAnd so that's hard to let go of. And for a while, I even go back to the beginning of my venture career, consumer internet was a good way to get out of the venture business if you had been doing it in 99 and 2000, because most of those companies had failed. But then you wouldn't have done\xa0[Facebook](https://speedwellresearch.com/2023/01/17/meta-platforms-deep-dive/). So these ageing aspects, if you're conscious of them, you can undermine them. I think it's not specific to venture. There are some jobs though, and I think particularly you look at someone like\xa0[Stan](https://aletteraday.substack.com/p/letter-40-john-collison-and-stan)\xa0[Druckenmiller](https://aletteraday.substack.com/p/letter-35-stan-druckenmiller-and), where 30 years of experience makes you a lot better. And in venture, I think you have to lay out, it makes you a lot better in some ways, it makes you a lot worse and other ways, and if you're conscious of it, you have a chance to overcome that, I think.\n\n\n**Eric:**\n\nThe advice I heard most often was be patient, don’t rush to make an investment, take time to get calibrated before making an investment…\n\nMy partner\xa0<mark>Matt Cohler had different advice. His was - the business is cyclical. Certain sectors will have a series of massive successes and then lay dormant for many years. Be aware of the cycle and the sector, and then trust your instincts.</mark> It’s good advice.\n\n\n**Peter:**\n\nDoing this job for almost 20 years now has taught me far more about people than about business. So let me first answer what I've learned about business, and in this case I mean the business of investing in startups. I started out as someone who had all the conceptual overhead needed to sound intelligent in our world, Porter's 5 Forces, the Innovators Dillema, and Crossing the Chasm. I would, in my former firm's parlance, develop a “prepared mind” in a sector so I could see where the logical opportunities should exist. I became an expert on Storage, on Application Software, on SupplyChain. All of that, <mark>I came to realize, was useless without the alchemy of an entrepreneur who was playing around with explosive market forces. Yes we can look, and it helps to look with a lens, but the best ideas and companies aren't filling logical white spaces.</mark> They are touching nuclear reactor of some force that will yield, and yield quickly, to an entrepreneurial leader.\n\nI also came to realize that at the beginning, no analysis can capture “what can go right” without sounding like you are clinically insane. Having seen the Series A pitch for Facebook, Uber, Snap, Twitter, VMware...$1B in revenue for any of those companies would have been nearly impossible to imagine. Yet in each of those cases, I vividly remember the meetings, the day, the setting...and this feeling that an exceptional entrepreneur had touched on something nobody else had understood at their level of depth and insight. Each in its own way felt limitless. I'll never forget meeting Evan Spiegel in 2012 at Sightglass in SF and leaving thinking, I know with all of my being that this person, this product, will give humanity back the playful joy of self expression, which had been stolen away by then current social networks. Sometimes it's obvious.\n\nSome other off the top of my head business lessons. I'd be a fraction of myself without my partners. Venture is a shoe-leather business, you can only be great if you are out looking engaging and hustling. <mark>Never turn down a company on valuation. It's a mental trap, and allows for weak thinking.</mark>\n\nBoard's are responsible to ensure the integrity of the Strategy, Stucture, and Staff. If the strategy is clear, the structure of the org should be aligned to that strategy, and the staff should be aligned to that org modelEntrepreneurial culture and professional culture will be in constant tension and conflict, and the art of the CEO is to balance both, and most CEOs don'tAlways, always pull the future forward on the organization you wantThe only time to lose fierce optimism is when you're out of money, in all other scenarios greatness is on the horizon\n\nWhat I've learned about people....the biggest lesson is that, simply put, the magic of human connection is the reason to do this job forever. The joy of being a partner, in the fullest sense, to a leader on the heroic journey of a startup inspires everything I want to contribute to this world.\n\nIn terms of specifics, I've learned that the one variable that defines a great relationship above all else is trust. I believe that comes from clarity of purpose, and shared-purpose. If there's a “hidden agenda” it's immediately obiovous to the subconscious mind, and it destroys trust. In a high trust relationship, I've found CEOs adapt and evolve at a higher positive rate. If there is one distinguishing trait in the best people I work with, they are learn-it-alls not know-it-alls. Another specific, I've also learned, as Peter Drucker said, where there are great peaks there are great valleys, and our job as a partner is to amplify the strengths and to recruit complements for the valleys. A final big lesson for me has been that motivation isn't a fixed constant. Everyone will go though periods, which can last for months at a time, when they have lost faith or confidence in the potential of the business, and in those situations it's essential as a partner to be a foundation of support and belief. It never ceases to amaze me how motivation can and almost always does return in full.\n\n\n\n## Enterprise vs. Consumer\n\n**Peter:**\n\nI think, to be a great investor, you need to do both. I might be alone in thinking so, because my partners would say it is better to focus and specialise. I believe we can benefit from cross-pollination in all aspects of our lives. You can help your enterprise company learn from the growth dynamics in consumer and apply incrementalism to problems, rather than having a wide-eyed approach towards growth. You can be more appealing as an investor, if you have a broader array of experience and sectors to draw from. You need to understand what is going on, and that is what I aspire to do.\n\n<mark>Consumer businesses are little less mechanical and have a more nuanced approach in both product design and its development.</mark> This is why Twitter is very different from Airbnb. E-commerce turns out to be more mechanical. A lot of it depends on the CEO’s ability to understand the sensibilities of what consumers want; this will have a huge impact on the underlying success of the product.\n\nContrastingly, it is more determined in the enterprise business. You know companies need a certain X, Y and Z; so, you build that. You have more control because you know you are building something that people are going to pay for. Most stress in a start-up comes from lack of control. Enterprise businesses have more control. What they don’t have is the amplitude of success that consumer companies have had.\n\n<mark>If you take the last decade or two, all $300 billion market cap companies are consumer enterprises.</mark> We have a $50 billion market cap company in Salesforce, which has been a great success in the enterprise space in the last 20 years. But that’s one. There are a handful of companies in $10-15 billion market cap; Workday is about 20 billion. Then, you have some $1-3 billion companies. Typically, in an enterprise business, <mark>if you are successful you are likely to be a $1-3 billion company but if the consumer business is successful, you can go on to scale to around $100-300 billion.</mark>\n\nMy strong conviction is that in the next three years, we will see a number of really big breakout IPOs in the open source space. Benchmark’s first investment in open source was Red Hat in the late 1990s; and now, it is a $14 billion market cap company. We made a dozen investments including MySQL, JBoss and SpringSource. While all of them were successful, the only breakout was Red Hat. We started investing in open source because earlier, for every dollar we invested in the enterprise business, about 70 cents was going towards selling the product.\n\nCompanies like Facebook, Twitter or Google spend zero dollars on convincing customers to use their product. Even Uber spends zero dollars on that kind of marketing. So, the insight was that because of the internet, you can get rid of the whole distribution chain between the author of the product and the user. What open source effectively allowed for is a new production model software, but importantly, it brought about a new distribution model where you can go straight to the source either through GitHub, or to an open source provider.\n\nBy dislocating and eliminating the middleman, we can create more quality and transparency. So now, instead of spending 70 cents on distribution, you can spend that on engineering. And once you have underlying consumption of the open source product, you can build extensions to the core business model. These could be selling advanced features in the\xa0[packaging business model](https://business.outlookindia.com/strategy/feature/all-season-cleaners-350), something which Red Hat and Hortonworks has done. We have about six possible investments coming up in the breakout category and those include Docker, Elasticsearch, Confluent and CockroachDB. By 2020, we will hopefully have three to five large open source companies.\n\n\n**Gurley**\n\nA lot of <mark>these consumer phenomena, we’ve found, have a lot to do with the go-to-market strategy of the individual</mark> — the way Zuckerberg brought Facebook out or the way Jeremy Stoppelman brought Yelp out. And a lot of it is this on-the-field playbook on how you light this fire, and so it allows for this phenomenon where we can say, “No one has gotten this right. But someone will put together the pieces right.”\n\n\n\n\n\n## Downturn\n\n\n**Gurley:**\n\nAnyone that studies finance for like a year should walk away with the attitude: micro, maybe; macro, no chance. It’s just so complex, there are so many variables.\n\n*Over Valued*\n\n\n- Most founders are biased towards optimism (as they should) and have a hard time optimizing for the realities of tough times.\n- An entire generation of entrepreneurs & tech investors built their entire perspectives on valuation during the second half of a 13-year amazing bull market run. The \"unlearning\" process could be painful, surprising, & unsettling to many.\n- Previous \"all-time\" highs are completely irrelevant. It's not \"cheap\" because it is down 70%. Forget those prices happened\n- Valuation multiples are always a hack proxy. Dangerous to use. If you insist, 10X should be considered AMAZING and an upper limit. Over that silly.\n\n*Layoff*\n\n\n- I hate the 5 to 10 percent layoffs. You don’t get any material impact to lowering your expenses. Yet you get all the cultural negatives of having done a layoff. You get 100 percent of the pain and very little gain.\n\nBenchmark never changes our investment cycle due to economic swings\n\nOur firm has a very unique focus. Around 85 to 90 percent of our funds are deployed on first-money and early-stage investments. And our approach has become even more unique because so many of our competitors have gone multistage.\nAnd once you start doing late-stage things, the current environment has a drastic impact. But if you're doing early-stage, these kinds of swings don't really put you off the next incremental investment. There have been plenty of great companies started in the troughs to suggest that there's no reason to stop investing.\n\nThe same thing is true at the peaks. There were firms that pulled out in '96 because they thought things had expanded too broadly, and they missed three of the greatest years of returns in the history of the business.\nWe really try to learn from our mistakes. We tried to expand internationally once, but it didn't work for us. So in about 2006, 2007, we capitulated and went back. And our conviction in our focus was even stronger, because we saw that we did better work once we refocused.\n\nWe had that on our mind as everyone in the Valley started expanding in more recent times. And I will tell you, for the six or seven years prior to the past year, people would meet with us and tell us that we were stupid, that we were leaving money on the table. But in the past six months, that's all reverted. Now it's all, oh, you guys are still brilliant.\nThere is another reason why I like our model. We're running much smaller funds than some of our peers, who probably pull down ten times the capital we do each year. Those firms have massive management fees as a result. As an investor, I just take more pride in us doing well when our limited partners are doing well. So if the majority of our compensation is on the carry side instead of the fee side, I just feel better about it.\n\n\n**Peter**:\nI think we are in a time when investors, marginal investors, are obsessed with growth, and obsessed with growth without a high degree of concern for operating income. In times like that, what invariably happens is [that] companies forget the income component of their P&L and they build a set of practices that are just not durable, because they burn through so much capital.\n\n\n**Peter**:\nThat we have this debate around bubble/non-bubble completely misses the point. The advice we try and give to the entrepreneurs is to visualize a world in which the capital goes away. And if they can visualize that world and still be okay, then proceed apace. It’s when you start to become dependent on that in macro conditions that become variable that you get caught.\n\nBill and I were practicing in the business in 2000 and saw these geniuses that became idiots, because all the assumptions changed in a brief period of time, when they lost the otherwise great opportunity in front of them. So that particular problem is pervasive, particularly in late-stage private companies where — <mark>if you just did an X-ray on the late-stage private world — my guess is the majority of those companies do not have durable expense rates.</mark>\nWell, they will be woken up, eventually.\n\n\nThe the part that rhymes, if you want to call it that, is the lived reality of valuation resets. It's been common across the cycle shifts, where public markets are wired up to be very nimble and agile and resets. Now, they still take six months time, sometimes they take longer, but broadly we've seen a catastrophic loss of value in the public tech stocks, 80% loss of value. That's not happened in the private sector. How does it happen the private sector? Slowly, and because so much money got put into the balance sheets of the companies that could raise it in the last 18 months, many of them, and broadly, in our portfolio, in the ecosystem, that got to higher valuations, are buying time. And there's a Maybe the market will recover by the time we need to get out there again. We'll see. But that reset takes more time in the private market, and it can lead to these weird distortions of the practical consideration of Is my equity grant real? And I think it stresses companies to sort of face the music in a sense, to say, Okay, let's know that we're not our valuation today. You never are, it's just a point in time…\n\n\nAnd so you say, Okay, isn't it nice that we're private, and we don't have to deal with that problem? It's like, you have to deal with that problem, it's just that it's not liquid. So I think it requires the great... the great companies will come back to that question of, Where are we in five to seven years if we manifest our strategy? How do we not let the stress of the financial market wreck that opportunity set? And you're gonna see a non-trivial number of companies. My instinct is that this is what rhymes with maybe more like 2000, or 2003, is that some percent, 25%, 50% of the companies are going to severely impair their five to seven year opportunity because of the access to capital problem.\n\n\nThey'll be in denial about the need to cut, they'll be in denial about the, Hey, if I just do this--this is a common conversation--we can get this valuation if we just do this. It's like no, you don't understand. If you just do what your plans were, you're still going to have an 80% lower valuation. And Whoa. And I'm struck particularly with younger people who say, We're going to grow into our multiple. The multiples gone! And so that part rhymes, which is the sense of denial. What doesn't rhyme, and I think this is the part which I will say that. I think one of the greatest traits of a good investor is a sense of bewilderment of not just being agnostic, but being really careful about any certainties. And I'm quite bewildered by the nature of inflation this time around.\n\n\nThe analogy that people have used, which makes sense to me, is it's more like cancer than the other flus that we've had. And in the venture business, I've seen two or three flus. One was very cute in 2008. It was a little more sustained than 2000 to 2004, maybe it's 2001 to 2004. This is the cancer in the sense that it tends to compound towards negative, and it gets worse and worse and worse until it gets fixed through chemotherapy, which is called high interest rates. We could imagine, it's not out of the realm of possibility, interest rates being above CPI to reset the economy. And that means what, 8, 9, 10% interest rates? Well, they were 20% in the 1980s. So if we get to that level, I think the question our companies don't really have a point of view about is when the cost of capital goes up 3-5x, maybe 10x, is some sub segment of what we're doing no longer economically viable? And that's probably the case, if you believe that the inflation remedy is 12, 15% interest rates. We're far away from that. And maybe it can course correct, maybe, but so this is where I think it's really different.\n\nAnd what does that mean practically, day to day? It doesn't really impact the Series A business, crazy as it is, because we still look for the same... I say Series A, <mark>I'm also putting a lass around what people call seed today. And preseed and prepreseed. Because those companies are not going to be exposed to the stresses of the cost of capital at this scale until five to seven years down the road</mark>, at which point there'll be some new reality, among other reasons. The terminal value may be different, but the nature of the alchemy of venture is all intact. I'm in the process right now of working with a former entrepreneur, and we're starting a company, he's starting it in them, and it feels like a great time to be starting a company.\n\n\nI think this is the human story that--I don't know how you can sever your emotional attenuation to the suffering that real people go through during a period like this. It's sort of one thing to say, Face the music, and You guys are all sinners in the hands of an angry God. It's another to say, Ugh, and it's gonna suck for a lot of people. And I think what I've tried to invest more in now with the founders I'm lucky enough to work with is building their emotional capabilities to deal with this. Because it is really vicious and hard. And there was a lot of stress during COVID, and from a CEO role it's so lonely, and then the number of the issues that they had to not be silent on, the issues that our society has systemically.\n\n\nThis is a different, more exhausting phenomenon. I'm more worried about how that may take somebody who's the next Tobi and cripple them in some fundamental ways from being in their full potential. So being a resource for our founders, to not just shame them into this is brutal times, but how do we help you get through this so that you're stronger through it? And that's really, I think, a unique role we can play because we're in the sense, like, as a founder, we have an unconditional commitment to the business... I mean, in theory, until we sell the stock when it's public, whereas employees are... and regrettably in some cases, you make them conditional. But we can be there through this, and I think give them some sense of continuity and ballast and that's when it's hardest for us to do our job. But we have to do it.\n\n\nI put jealousy and schaudenfreud up there as probably the worst human vices. And they tend to lead to cruelty, which is THE worst human vice, from my vantage point. So, yeah, it is going to be very challenging for anybody that has high exposure for the last three years to get back to even. It may take a very long time, and what does that mean to those funds and our access to capital? Right now, there's still this weird reality distortion, right? Because the marked values don't reflect the If everyone had to raise money tomorrow, what's the real value? If you told all of them, Guess what, your portfolio's down indexed to what the public market's down, I think that the LPs would be quite surprised. Not that they don't know that instinctively. And they're all trying to do the right thing and stay true to the... But how does that impact the capital long term? I think you have the same basic phenomenon, which is that <mark>private venture investing doesn't outperform the NASDAQ. And that that is a bitter pill that people have to swallow</mark>. Now, there's the tautological statement that the top 10% of the funds outperform... Okay... And <mark>if you're 10% this time, you have a higher probability being top 10% next time...</mark>\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Side Notes\n\nBenchmark wasn’t always true to its credo. During the dot-com bubble, it made a bid to go global, opening offices in London and Tel Aviv. Though the results were solid, the firm dynamics grew increasingly strained. Gurley missed out on Skype by trying to hand the investment off to his European partners, and the different offices struggled not to step on each other's toes.\n\nBy 2007 they began to scrap the experiment, spinning out the firm's European and Israeli units. “We weren’t doing it for a little more money, we were doing it because we thought the brand had an international appeal,” says Fenton. “But if you have a small equal partnership, you can’t have a leadership figure. And to run an international partnership, you need a CEO.”\n\nBeing small can have its downsides: Some major tech companies have slipped through Benchmark’s grasp.\n\nA few of big misses:\n\n- Google: Benchmark had a chance to pursue but didn’t\n- Airbnb: Benchmark initially got a bad read(Cohle).\n- Slack: the partners tested but never met.\n- Clubhouse: a16z won (Andreessen Horowitz also pitched its wide range of services, even using its Hollywood connections to wrangle celebrities like the comedian Kevin Hart to join the app.)\n- Cursor: Benchmark couldn't lead the round\n\nIn 2020, Benchmark asked themselves if their small model still worked. They debated this issue when Miles Grimshaw who just joined Benchmark from Thrive Capital. They again decided to stay small. In 2024, Miles rejoined Thrive.\n\n\n### Instagram\n\nKevin mentioned [Matt Choler was very helpful during the acq](https://x.com/TechEmails/status/1673074975186771969) on [Lex's Podcast](https://youtu.be/3pvpNKUPbIY?si=t1H_uF6XHdYmKjz1&t=3697).\n\n\n### Uber\n\nFormer Uber CEO Travis Kalanick shared a story at [the All-In Summit 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j7lwauJN2s) about how he was fired by Benchmark.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Travis Kalanick | All-In Summit 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j7lwauJN2s)\n- [Benchmark Part II: The Dinne](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/benchmark-part-ii-the-dinner)r\n- [Benchmark Part I](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/benchmark-capital)\n- [Peter Fenton, VC and Founder Mindsets, Current Market State and Rashad’s New Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbWTRq4CEUQ)\n- [Peter Fenton and Logan Bartlett (2022)](https://aletteraday.substack.com/p/letter-47-peter-fenton-and-logan?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)\n- [Quora Session with Eric Vishria](https://quorasessionwithericvishria.quora.com/)\n- [Peter Fenton Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Fenton?q=Peter%20Fenton)\n- [The Benchmark Way: Five Partners Who Make Other VC Firms Look Outgunned And Overstaffed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/03/25/benchmark-makes-other-firms-look-outmatched/?sh=26be51f04006)\n- [Bill Gurley: We View Benchmark As A Services Business](https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/bill-gurley-we-view-benchmark-as-a-services-business/)\n- [Benchmark Capital's Stand: We Will Never Do a Seed or Late Stage Fund](https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/29/benchmark-capitals-stand-we-will-never-do-a-seed-or-late-stage-fund/)\n- [Benchmark Capital Stays Lean, Even After $14 Billion Bonanza](https://www.wsj.com/articles/benchmark-capital-stays-lean-even-after-14-billion-bonanza-1534880030)\n- [Sunday Conversation with Peter Fenton, Benchmark Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmj9Nkt_4Jw&list=PLvPrgtsNL8-nsBevrAnGpwAGPHPUXjLwY)\n- [Bill Gurley -

Initially each school was its own island, and then once we had enough schools we started to link the schools together which lead to network effects both within and across schools. It\\u2019s worth noting that these early chapters at Facebook involved very little true \\u201Cviral marketing\\u201D or \\u201Cgrowth hacking\\u201D and the early growth at Thefacebook was more linear than exponential as a function of the limitations on who could sign up. I remember being surprised to see how few typical viral mechanisms were built into the product when I first started exploring it in 2004, even by the standards of that time.

In 2003 when LinkedIn launched (many people don\\u2019t realize that LinkedIn launched almost a year before Thefacebook!) the two primary distribution channels available to us were web search and email. LinkedIn profiles and content weren\\u2019t showing up meaningfully in search results so we couldn\\u2019t make much use of SEO. This was because we were very concerned about user privacy and control - in 2003 LinkedIn was actually the first service of any real size where people were putting their full first and last name on a user-generated profile online, and there were originally no pictures on user profiles by design. So email virality was the primary channel available to us for distribution. Like with all exponential functions there was a long initial tail on this viral growth, and Thefacebook actually reached 1,000,000 users much faster than LinkedIn despite not having virality engineered into the product.

He recently announced that he is stepping back from investing at Founders Fund (as partner emeritus, Singerman can still bring in new deals but will take fewer pitches day to day).\n\nSingerman has had more exits than any of his colleagues, Thiel included. It was Singerman who worked hard to nudge his colleagues into biotech in 2012, an industry they knew little about. His $300 million bet on Stemcentrx paid off when it was acquired by the pharma giant AbbVie in April 2016. The investment single-handedly delivered a profit of $1.4 billion in 2017.\n\n## Famous Bets Led by Brian\n\n**Stemcentrx**: Invested $300 million in Stemcentrx. AbbVie acquired Stemcentrx for up to $10.2 billion. Founders Fund owned about 16%. (In the first check, they invested around 7% of their fund.)\n\n- Airbnb\n- Oculus\n- Anduril\n- Affirm\n- Wish\n- Postmates\n- Solugen\n- Cloud9\n- Oscar Health\n- Earn.com\n- AltSchool\n\n**About the SpaceX investment**: Founders Fund put $20 million into SpaceX in 2008. “It wasn’t clear to anyone that this was going to work, every rocket had blown up.” One potential investor walked away. Another accidentally copied the partners on an email that said they’d lost their minds. SpaceX is currently valued at $350 billion, at least 8% of which belongs to Founders Fund.\n\n**Why FF is the GOAT**: Less than 10 firms in venture history have three or more consecutive 5x+ DPI funds:\n\n![Framer\'s Component Picker](/images/blog/ff.png)\n\n\nBrian was recruited by his good friend Sean in 2007 when they had just started Founders Fund. Brian mentioned, “…I met up with the Founders Fund guys. They hadn’t made the investment but were considering this crazy investment in something called SpaceX, and I was like, ‘Oh, I want to be part of stuff like this.’ So I came on board specifically because SpaceX didn’t need a $50k check—SpaceX needed a real check. I wanted to be part of that. To me, that was an example of a world-changing company, one of the most important companies on the planet. I came on board because I wanted to do stuff like that."\n\n## Style\n\n### "A Pure Upside Gamer”\n\n“Anytime I look at a company, regardless of stage, sector, or anything else, I have to answer the following three questions:\n\n- Is the market big enough to support a very large company?\n- Does the company have some sort of existing moat (hard to copy)? Not like, ‘Oh, if they do this and this and this,’ but does the company have a real, existing moat? It can be anything—I’m open to all sorts of different things—but it has to have a real moat.\n- Does it have the founder and management team to take it from that current moat all the way through to the strategic, huge market endpoint?\n\nHaving any dogmatic blanket rule is almost always a mistake.”\n\n\n### How to Spot a Company That’s Starting a New Hype Cycle\n\n**Instead of Chasing an Old One**: You wouldn’t describe the company as “the Uber for X” or “the Tinder for Y.” A first-of-its-kind company can’t be categorized neatly in comparison to an existing company.\n\nAs Peter Thiel likes to say, the founder should have a “secret,” an understanding of a truth about the world that others have yet to recognize. This secret gives the founder a differentiated point of view from the very beginning and allows the company to tackle problems in a distinctive way.\n\nNot everyone would choose to invest. If every single VC is lining up at the company’s door to invest, the company likely isn’t doing anything new. Most VCs are only comfortable investing in companies operating in sectors they already have a thesis for. A company that CREATES a hype cycle requires investors to envision a new world outside of their existing theses.\n\nThe company has the potential for a monopoly outcome. At the time of its founding, the company won’t have any natural competitors, aside from legacy incumbents that aren’t equipped to compete. Competitors may spring up in the company’s wake as the hype cycle heats up, but the company’s first-mover advantage gives it a head start that allows it to dominate the marketplace and escape commodification.\n\n\n### Venture is Purely an Upside Game\n\n“Venture capital, to me, is purely a game of upside maximization. And while this may get me in trouble, I actually don’t care about downside minimization—it’s completely unimportant to me.”\n\n### Moats That Can’t Be Cloned\n\n“Does it have some sort of existing moat? Not like, ‘Oh, if they do this and this and this,’ but does the company have a real, existing moat? It can be anything—I’m open to all sorts of different things—but it has to have a real moat. Does it have the founder and management team to take it from that current moat all the way through to the strategic, huge market endpoint?”\n\n### Sector Agnostic\n\n“Sean Parker is the best proactive venture capitalist of all time. I am not a proactive venture capitalist. I am a reactive venture capitalist. I think I’m an excellent reactive venture capitalist. And I think in order to be truly, truly sector agnostic, you have to be reactive.”\n\n“I call myself a very reactive venture capitalist. Meaning that I’m open to any ideas and anything that comes in the door. The reason this is relevant to your question is that I spend less time philosophizing about the macro state of things because they’re not relevant to finding a good company, right? To be truly open to any company that walks in your door, it also means not having any preconceived notions about how the world should look, needs to look, or does look. So I spend less time focusing on macro questions and philosophical questions and more time focusing on companies.”\n\n### Conviction = Invest a Lot\n\n“The key to the strategy is that once we have conviction, we are willing to invest a lot. With Stemcentrx, over multiple rounds, we invested something like $300 million. It’s not enough to think something is going to be one of the most important companies on the planet—you have to back it up. So, to me, venture capital is about having conviction and putting a lot of money behind it. We back the truck up when we have conviction.”\n\n### We Don’t Ever Think About Co-Investors\n\n“We’ve made so many investments where we were the only ones in for a long time, like Palantir and Stemcentrx. People ask, ‘Didn’t you want someone to come in and give validation?’ What do I need validation from another VC for? No. If there’s another VC firm that really believes in the company and they can be helpful, great. But I’m not looking for any validation from them.”\n\n“The best investments are the ones that turn out to be good that other people didn’t think were going to be good. If everybody thinks something is amazing and it’s the greatest thing, then the price is going to get bid up like crazy. It’s going to be super competitive. Your returns are not going to come from that. Your returns are going to come almost entirely from the investments you make where most people do not think it’s a good investment, but it turns out to be really good. That’s where your huge multiples are going to come from in venture.”\n\n“Just because something is contrarian doesn’t make it right. The key thing in investing is to be both contrarian and right. There are often cases where the echo chamber is going to be right, and there are a lot of cases where the echo chamber is going to be wrong. The goal is not to always go against the echo chamber. The idea is to focus on where, ‘Wow! I just believe this thing is going to work even though it flies in the face of what other people believe.’ That is a hard skill. You have to be willing to be unpopular, which not everybody is willing to do.”\n\n“In fact, one of the questions I often ask candidates is, ‘Are you willing to do something that may put you in an uncomfortable position with your friends because they don’t agree with you on something?’ You’ve got to be willing to make those kinds of decisions. That being said, the most important thing is to be right in venture—whether it’s consensus or contrarian. The most important thing is to be right.”\n\n### Game of Minimal Luck\n\n“I don’t like board games unless they’re quick. I don’t like board games with too much luck. So my favorite board games are the ones that have very minimal luck, or luck that can be mitigated to a large extent. If they have a lot of luck, i.e., dice rolls, but they’re a five-minute game, that’s fine. But the worst games, in my mind, are the ones that take 10 hours and where dice decide the outcome, because 10 hours isn’t even enough for the dice to smooth out the variance, yet it’s such a long game to have variance be dominant.”\n\n### Anonymous Founder’s Feedback\n\n“They led our (largish) seed round. I had a slightly negative experience with one partner, but the person we worked with beat most firms we talked to in first-principles thinking by quite a margin. They were all very bright and had a wide range of knowledge. They were far less interested in ‘who else is in’ and more interested in your analysis of your business from basic building blocks. When we were doing due diligence on them, the main ‘complaint’ we heard from people who had raised from them is that it’s hard to read their judgment. They may seem bearish on you, then invest last minute, or the opposite. Most people had great things to say, though.”',title:"Notes on Brian Singerman",date:new Date("2022-12-30T21:00:00.000Z"),summary:"Move too slow",cover:"/images/blog/ai.png",coverAlt:"A metallic rainbow artwork on a black background.",category:"notes",_meta:{filePath:"bsin.mdx",fileName:"bsin.mdx",directory:".",extension:"mdx",path:"bsin"},mdx:'var Component=(()=>{var m=Object.create;var a=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,y=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),v=(n,e)=>{for(var o in e)a(n,o,{get:e[o],enumerable:!0})},h=(n,e,o,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e=="object"||typeof e=="function")for(let i of g(e))!y.call(n,i)&&i!==o&&a(n,i,{get:()=>e[i],enumerable:!(r=u(e,i))||r.enumerable});return n};var b=(n,e,o)=>(o=n!=null?m(p(n)):{},h(e||!n||!n.__esModule?a(o,"default",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):o,n)),w=n=>h(a({},"__esModule",{value:!0}),n);var l=f((S,s)=>{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};v(k,{default:()=>c});var t=b(l());function d(n){let e={h2:"h2",h3:"h3",img:"img",li:"li",p:"p",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...n.components};return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:"Brian Singerman, one of my favorite Silicon Valley VC/gamer figures alongside Sean Parker, is a former partner at Founders Fund and one of the few venture capitalists in Silicon Valley\\u2019s history capable of making bold bets while achieving massive returns.

I’ve worked with a bunch of object-oriented languages, but Haskell just clicks differently. It’s designed with efficiency in mind, letting you write expressive code without constantly worrying about errors popping up at runtime. Unlike a lot of other languages, it doesn’t demand endless error-checking and defensive coding, so I can focus more on making my code do what I intend.\n\nIn 2017, I had the chance to lead a Haskell team at Cond\xe9 Nast International(北京、上海), where we worked on backend projects for brands like Vogue, GQ, and a secret WIRED AI project. For "open-minded?" developers familiar with languages like Java, Python, or C++, getting productive in Haskell takes a little time—usually around two or three months with coaching and self-study. By the six-month mark, though, most dev feel quite confident with Haskell’s ecosystem and can dive into nearly any task. It’s true that Haskell’s abstractions can feel unusual at first, but once you get the hang of it, it drastically reduces the mental juggling you’d typically need in other languages.\n\nOne of Haskell’s strengths is how it lightens the cognitive load. In languages like C++ or Java, you’re constantly managing stuff like memory, object lifetimes, and performance hacks, all of which can slow down development and introduce tricky bugs. Haskell takes most of that off your plate. Its strong static typing and way of making side effects explicit eliminate whole classes of errors at compile time, so there’s a lot less worrying about weird bugs slipping through.\n\n\n**The Challenges of Using Haskell in Startups**\n\nIt does come with some challenges — especially if you’re in a fast-moving startup.\n\n1. The Haskell ecosystem lacks the kind of mature, ready-to-go libraries and frameworks you find in languages like Python or JavaScript. This often means building more things from scratch, which can slow things down if you’re on a tight deadline.\nTechnical Hurdles\n\n2. Compilation Speed: Haskell’s compiler can be very slow, which can feel like a drag when you’re iterating frequently.\n\n3. Error Reporting: The compiler stops at the first error, so you might end up chasing issues one at a time instead of getting a full view of what needs fixing.\n\n4. Tooling: Compared to languages like Python, Haskell’s tooling is limited. IDE support, debugging, and refactoring tools are still developing, so working in Haskell can feel like more of a manual process.\n\n**Ecosystem Limitations**\n\nThe library ecosystem can also be a drawback, especially if you’re working on enterprise-grade projects. Many libraries are either incomplete or unmaintained, which can be a risk if you’re relying on them for core functionality. As a team lead, I saw firsthand how these gaps could slow down development when you’re always troubleshooting or looking for alternatives.\n\nDespite these challenges, I’m still a big believer in what Haskell brings to the table. Even if it’s not the go-to language for startups, Haskell’s ideas—like lazy evaluation, monads, and algebraic data types—have shaped the design of other languages and frameworks. Working with Haskell has made me a better developer and changed the way I think about coding, period.\n\nWhile it might never be the popular choice, its impact is lasting and has inspired a wave of functional programming that’s woven into modern software development.\n\n---\n\n### Note\n\nHaskell’s lazy evaluation and higher-order functions also make it easy to combine small functions to tackle complex problems without a ton of boilerplate code. Here are a few examples to show how this works:\n\n**Example 1: Filtering List Elements**\n\n```haskell\ndata Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }\n\npeople = [ Person "Alice" 25, Person "Bob" 32, Person "Charlie" 19 ]\n\nnamesOver21 :: [Person] -> [String]\nnamesOver21 = map name . filter ((>21) . age)\n\nmain = print $ "Names over 21: " ++ show (namesOver21 people)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `Person` data type, filters the list to include only those over 21, and maps their names into a new list. It showcases how Haskell’s higher-order functions allow for complex operations to be expressed in a concise and declarative manner.\n\n**Example 2: Leveraging Lazy Evaluation**\n\n```haskell\n-- Infinite sequence of natural numbers\nnaturals :: [Integer]\nnaturals = iterate (+1) 0\n\n-- Take elements from the infinite sequence until a number greater than 10 is found\ntakeWhileLessThan10 :: [Integer] -> [Integer]\ntakeWhileLessThan10 = takeWhile (<= 10)\n\nmain = print $ takeWhileLessThan10 naturals\n```\n\nHaskell’s lazy evaluation allows the program to generate and process an infinite sequence, halting when a condition is met. This approach avoids unnecessary computation and exemplifies how Haskell can efficiently manage potentially vast data sets.\n\n**Example 3: Using Higher-Order Functions**\n\n```haskell\n-- Define a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1..10]\n\n-- Use map to double each number in the list\ndoubleNumbers :: [Integer] -> [Integer]\ndoubleNumbers = map (*2)\n\n-- Use filter to keep only even numbers\nevenNumbers :: [Integer] -> [Integer]\nevenNumbers = filter even\n\nmain = do\n    let doubled = doubleNumbers numbers\n    let evens = evenNumbers doubled\n    print $ "Doubled and filtered numbers: " ++ show evens\n```\n\nThis example illustrates how Haskell’s `map` and `filter` functions can be combined to transform and filter data declaratively, without the need for complex control structures.\n\n**Example 4: Harnessing Algebraic Data Types**\n\n\n```haskell\ndata Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving Show\n\n-- Function to count the number of nodes in a tree\ncountNodes :: Tree a -> Int\ncountNodes (Leaf _) = 1\ncountNodes (Node left right) = 1 + countNodes(left) + countNodes(right)\n\nmain = do\n    let tree = Node (Leaf "hello") (Node (Leaf "world") (Leaf "!"))\n    print $ "Number of nodes: " ++ show (countNodes tree)\n```\n\nHere, algebraic data types are used to define a binary tree, and pattern matching provides a concise and readable way to traverse and process the structure.',title:"Haskell Is Not Startup-Friendly",date:new Date("2018-12-30T21:00:00.000Z"),summary:"Move too slow",cover:"/images/blog/haskell.webp",coverAlt:"A metallic rainbow artwork on a black background.",category:"blog",_meta:{filePath:"haskell.mdx",fileName:"haskell.mdx",directory:".",extension:"mdx",path:"haskell"},mdx:'var Component=(()=>{var g=Object.create;var i=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,f=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var w=(a,e)=>()=>(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),k=(a,e)=>{for(var t in e)i(a,t,{get:e[t],enumerable:!0})},s=(a,e,t,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e=="object"||typeof e=="function")for(let o of m(e))!f.call(a,o)&&o!==t&&i(a,o,{get:()=>e[o],enumerable:!(r=u(e,o))||r.enumerable});return a};var y=(a,e,t)=>(t=a!=null?g(p(a)):{},s(e||!a||!a.__esModule?i(t,"default",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):t,a)),b=a=>s(i({},"__esModule",{value:!0}),a);var d=w((H,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var v={};k(v,{default:()=>h});var n=y(d());function c(a){let e={code:"code",h3:"h3",hr:"hr",img:"img",li:"li",ol:"ol",p:"p",pre:"pre",strong:"strong",...a.components};return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:"(2018)"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:"/images/blog/haskell.webp",alt:"OpenAI logo"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:"Functional programming, especially Haskell, has completely reshaped how I think about software development.

logo](/images/blog/matrix.png)\n\n\n精神分析其實最違反人性，因為它們最終會讓你發現，其實你的自我認知，和生存的世界都是虛幻不實的。\n\n人最大的恐懼不在於我們知道自己會死。而在於驚覺原來自我是不存在的，因為那裡既沒有一個你稱之為「我」的東西存在，更無所謂這個本質上幻覺的「自我」有生命的意義可以提供執著攀附的基礎。從思想的角度來看，電影《駭客任務》便是這種哲學的縮影。\n\n電影中分別兩次傳輸「我」的虛幻性，對應著主體的雙重醒悟。第一次覺醒是 Morpheus 造成的，程式設計師 Anderson 看到原來他生活的世界只不過是一堆符號的堆砌而已。我們都和 Anderson 一樣在這個符號世界裡打拼和享樂。社交地位，金錢，名聲，物質都不過是一條條源源不息的意識之流，把我們整個身心束縛，幻化成你所謂的「生命的意義」。\n\n這些東西皆是符號，它們充斥著自我價值或者生命的意義的幻學，我們卻昏昏沉沉、汲汲營營奮力地追求這些符號，而不知道自己真正需要的是什麼。\n\nNeo 並沒有真正脫離母體（the Matrix）話語霸權的控制，他只是以為自己自由了而已。而沒有覺察到其實真正限制他獲取自由的力量，便是來自於他的欲望，也就是說，對自由、成就和愛情的渴求才是真正束縛 Neo 的東西。而這些欲望包括承載著這些欲望的「我」，剛好也是母體編譯的程式。\n\n《駭客任務》真正的恐懼開始於先知指示 Neo 要「認識自己」，而到了第三集，Neo 見到了母體的創造者時，這個恐懼的謎底揭開。系統管理員對 Neo 說的那段話其實很簡單。無非是說，其實你 Neo 和 Anderson 一樣，不過是一段段符號構成的東西而已。雖然先知偷偷幫你加上了「愛情」這段程式，讓你的行為增加了一段隨機性，但是這並不能改變你的自我的虛無的符號本質。愛這個東西甚至沒有改變你的命運，便是最終回到母體而消亡。\n\nArchitech 和 Neo 對話時，我們看到，在四周圍牆上佈滿了電視螢幕，上面有無數個 Neo 存在。而 Neo 必須認同其中一個自我表像才能繼續思考和對話，一旦注意力不集中，他的自我就立即分裂成無數個「小我」在那裡自說自話了。也就是說，並沒有一個固定不變的、主宰一切的「我」存在。「我」是由無數的影像、記憶、感情、思維構成的。「我」就像一個洋蔥，一層又一層，你可以說這每一層洋蔥皮都是洋蔥，也可以說它們不是洋蔥。「我」是一種錯覺，「我」只存在於二元的網路之中。\n\n\n### 虛幻的現實\n\n![OpenAI logo](/images/blog/hacker.png)\n\n\n駭客任務讓人難以承受之處就在於它宣稱，我們稱之為「現實」的東西，其實和電腦上的數位訊號、產品一樣是虛擬、虛幻的。\n\n人一生中所面臨的事物，就像永無止境的意識、念頭海浪，一波接著一波而來，但我們到死亡的最後，還是兩手空空，什麼也留不住；我們的腦中閃過無數的念頭，一個念頭又生出許許許多多的念頭，但所有的念頭都只會增加內心的騷動。\n\n假如仔細思考 我們所依據的世界觀，並試著找出它們從何而來，就會發現，這一切都源自我們未能對事物做正確的檢驗。 我們的所作所為，通常是根據「每一件事都是真實、具有實體」的假設而來。 但是， 當我們看仔細一點就會發現，現實世界就像一道彩虹，色彩鮮豔多姿，卻沒有任何實體存在 。\n\nThe Matrix, 母體，也就是我們每個人每天從早到晚看到、聽到、聞到、品嘗到、觸摸到、想像到客體世界。太陽、音樂、香氛、美味、柔滑、成功，統統都是你大腦內的一串串神經衝動，完全可以被轉化為一個個符號，一條條數學曲線。\n\n在電影裡，現實是虛無的，說起來一切人、物，情感起伏，都只是程式依著邏輯學進行編譯演算而已。而「我」，只是一串串數位訊號、神經系統、人類文化、童年教養、人際溝通、社會生活製造出來的一個產品，是認同、執著、攀緣、攝取的造成的幻象。而愛情和成就是 「我」這個虛幻的假象繁殖出來的最重要也是最甜美的兩個幻象。程式設計師道破了 Neo 的成就幻象的本質，而 Trinity 的死亡最終觸發 Neo 產生了第二次的醒悟。那就是，無論「我」還是我所愛的東西其實都是一堆堆不斷閃爍燃燒的基本粒子的火焰而已。它們沒有主宰，不受控制，閃現之後即刻消失。\n\n這一次，他親眼看到了自我和這個世界的本質。然後，正如我們看到的，Neo 死了。或者應該說，「我」死了。就像自我的面孔在鏡子中出現又消失，面孔並非存於鏡內，當它不再於鏡中顯現時，它也沒有真正消失，鏡子本身也從無任何改變過。",title:"駭客任務與無我的世界觀",date:new

I’ve been thinking about this idea ever since I started playing Fortnite back in 2018. In the game, players use all kinds of skins (avatars) and emotes to express themselves and connect with friends. But I noticed something interesting — my friends were often curious to see each other’s real facial reactions behind the avatars during gameplay. That made me wonder: what if we could extend this avatar-based social experience beyond games and into everyday smartphone use?\n\n2. A virtual identity without real emotional input doesn’t feel trustworthy over time. We all know emojis don’t always capture how we actually feel. While many social apps already offer avatar systems, people tend to use them more like animated stickers or fancy emojis—not as true representations of themselves. What we’re building is different:\n\n**an emotional bridge between a person and their avatar**\n\n### What we learned\n\n- Even a neutral expression carries more meaning than plain text\n\n- People often add facial expressions when replying to DMs to make interactions more fun\n\n- Facial emotions create a deeper sense of connection when building new relationships\n\n---\n\n# Short Deck\n\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu1.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu2.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu3.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu4.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu5.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu5.1.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu6.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu7.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu8.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu9.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu10.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu11.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu12.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu13.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu14.jpeg)\n\n![Framer's Component Picker](/images/blog/miu-b.jpeg)",title:"Sunsetting Miurror (2023)",date:new Date("2023-01-04T21:00:00.000Z"),summary:"Avatar-First Social App",cover:"/images/projects/miudemo.gif",coverAlt:"A metallic rainbow artwork on a black background.",category:"blog",_meta:{filePath:"miurror.mdx",fileName:"miurror.mdx",directory:".",extension:"mdx",path:"miurror"},mdx:'var Component=(()=>{var h=Object.create;var t=Object.defineProperty;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var u=Object.getPrototypeOf,f=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var b=(i,e)=>()=>(e||i((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),k=(i,e)=>{for(var r in e)t(i,r,{get:e[r],enumerable:!0})},s=(i,e,r,o)=>{if(e&&typeof e=="object"||typeof e=="function")for(let a of d(e))!f.call(i,a)&&a!==r&&t(i,a,{get:()=>e[a],enumerable:!(o=p(e,a))||o.enumerable});return i};var y=(i,e,r)=>(r=i!=null?h(u(i)):{},s(e||!i||!i.__esModule?t(r,"default",{value:i,enumerable:!0}):r,i)),j=i=>s(t({},"__esModule",{value:!0}),i);var m=b((C,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var w={};k(w,{default:()=>g});var n=y(m());function c(i){let e={a:"a",em:"em",h1:"h1",h3:"h3",hr:"hr",img:"img",li:"li",ol:"ol",p:"p",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...i.components};return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:"(2023.Jan)"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:"/images/blog/miu0.jpeg",alt:"Framer\'s Component Picker"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.strong,{children:"Intro"}),": Miurror is an iOS messenger app that shows you the facial reactions of your friends in virtual avatars when they read/reply to your message."]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:"/images/projects/miudemo.gif",alt:"Framer\'s Component Picker"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.strong,{children:"Status"}),": \\u{1FAA6}\\u2620\\uFE0F 2022-Jan 2023, Development has been shut down following Google\\u2019s acquisition of the SDK that we relied on."]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsxs)(e.em,{children:["A heartfelt thank you to ",(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{href:"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic",children:"@TimSweeney"})," for his incredible generosity and support."]})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.h3,{children:"Why Miurror"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.ol,{children:[`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.li,{children:[`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:"I\\u2019ve been thinking about this idea ever since I started playing Fortnite back in 2018.

The specific from he recommended, which I love, is what would a series A round into the Manhattan Project have looked like? How do you think about this financing of very complex and therefore meaningful and worthwhile projects?\n\n\nMarc: [00:48:15] You'd do it by process of elimination, work backwards, which is why did you need Apple to do the iPhone? Why wasn't the iPhone a startup? There are a lot of big advances over the last 30 or 40 years. To your point, especially in these more complex fields and they come out of these big companies that entrepreneurs tend to be building the software. It goes back to this thing of, why do you have these large scale industrial conglomerates?\nWhy can't you have more startups that are Tesla and SpaceX, is ultimately the question. Part of that is you read the story of Tesla and SpaceX and it's the story of just a couple of things jump out at you. One is this story of just unbelievable drama, and stress, and risk. Elon almost lost both companies at different points multiple times. Very tenuous whether those companies could raise money at this point in time.\nThe classic venture backed financing model, you're raising your round of money every two or three years, you need to assume you're doing it with a new lead investor each time. If you need five, or six, or seven rounds of financing to get a complex product to market, but if you can't raise that third or fourth round of financing, it's game over, you lose the whole company.\nSo I would say this is a criticism of Silicon valley that I give a little bit of credence to, which is these big, hairy, audacious projects that involve lots of moving parts, they are just hard to do with the classic venture financing model because of this need to raise multiple rounds of capital.\n\nWhat would be the alternative to that? What would be the counterfactual where you could have told Elon Musk up front, \"We're just going to pre-commit $5 billion to build Tesla or SpaceX.\" By the way, oh, this is the other thing with Tesla and SpaceX, which is they're the only examples. Why are there a hundred more Teslas and SpaceXes? Why are there not companies building automated machine factories building thousands of houses for a fraction of the cost of today? Or why are there not these huge new universities or robotic automated hospitals? All these things that the world pretty clearly needs, where are the startups to do those things?\nWhy do we only have Elon and why do we only have cars and rockets? And so it's like, okay, well, what if you had a system in which you could pre-commit 5 billion and you could pre-commit 5billion and youcould pre−commit s5 billion to a project like Tesla, or SpaceX, or any of these other projects, and you were willing to do that because you knew that if the thing works, it would do what Tesla have SpaceX have done, which is you would generate equity value far in excess of that.\n\nSo you put five billion into Tesla over the course of, whatever, its first 10 years, and then if it worked, it's worth 500 billion on the other side and you make a hundred X. That's a venture scale venture capital style proposition that actually looks quite attractive.\nSo then it's like, well, what would it take to basically make an upfront commitment to somebody for $5 billion? Okay, that's interesting. So question number one is, could you raise the money to do that? And actually in the old days, the answer to that probably was no. In the current world, the answer that is probably yes. There are a set of high end VCs or private equity firms that could probably raise that money to have a program like that. There's this global savings glut, there's just trillions of dollars in accumulated capital out in the economy that just doesn't know where to do.\n\nThere's 15 trillion of negative yield in government debt in Europe. There's these giant sovereign wealth funds that have no idea how to invest their money. And so, if they had a chance to invest in another dozen or a hundred attempts to have a new Tesla, they probably would go for it if you had a responsible plan. So, okay, could you raise some money to do it? And then, there's the what's the responsible way to pre-commit $5 billion, right?\n\n#### Patrick: [00:51:07] Right. How to you let the entrepreneur draw it or something?\n\nMarc: [00:51:09] Right, exactly. And there's an old idea that I think could be brought back and it's a term called project finance. And it's basically how you finance a dam, or a bridge, or a new highway, or something like that. It's tranche money. It's tranche money corresponding to milestones. You basically have a plan, the plan has very specific milestones along the way, the burn rate escalates over time. You've got these milestone check-ins over time, and then you pre-commit the money, but the money gets released in chunks so the money gets released conditional on progress.\n\nYou predefine the plan in a much more rigorous way than the general venture-backed startup does, and then you unlock the money as you go, and then basically you would build a portfolio of these investments. So you would probably start, you'd raised some huge funds, you would nominally commit five billion each to a whole bunch of projects, and then you would basically take its course, and a bunch of the projects would not hit their milestones, hopefully relatively early in the process. You'd kill those projects. You would end up funneling most of the money into the set of projects that actually that were making the right kind of progress.\n\nAnd this is a doable thing, it's a doable methodology.

Remember the Yo app? or CryptoKitties? Lots of initial traction, and then a quick fade.\n\n**Product-Market Fit (PMF)**\n\nPMF can rise and fall as the product and market change and grow. It’s not this static thing that once you get it, you always have it.\n\nKeep the cycle going to sustain product market fit - Stay in touch with your users, identify which ones are in your target market, double down on your strengths, continue to remove reasons for users to not love you.\n\nProduct is both an art and a science. Viable Fit takes care of the science so you can focus on the art. Viable Fit helps surface problems and areas to focus on. How you tackle those problems are totally up to you and that’s where the art of product management comes in.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Product-market fit is a spectrum, as opposed to something you definitely have or don’t\n\n- Every business is unique, and metrics frameworks apply differently. Focus on the metrics that matter for your product, and make sure they’re clearly defined\n\n- Benchmark: Users scream for the product so you can screw everything up still win (for a period of time)\n\n- Prove a value hypothesis and only once you've proven the value hypothesis should you test a growth hypothesis. PMF is when you have proven the value hypothesis.\n\n**Andy Rachleff on PMF**\n\n> Don used to say, \"I'm looking to invest in companies that can screw everything up and still succeed because the customer pulls the product out of their hands.\" I'm paraphrasing. I'm not sure I got that exactly right. He felt that way because the startup will screw everything up. I want a company that has such demand from the market that they can literally screw everything up and still succeed. - Andy Rachleff\n\n(Actual viral behavior)\n\nHow to test it? If you give someone your product for free for 30 days, and then abruptly take it away from them:\n\n- ==“If the customer doesn’t scream, you don’t have product-market fit because if they’re not going to buy it at the end of 30 days, they’re not desperate, and if they’re not desperate, you don’t have product-market fit.”==\n\n- ==\"Never iterate on your product to cater to a potential customer’s beliefs\"==\n\n### On B2C Side\n\n**Exponential and organic growth**\n\n“The only way you know if you have product-market fit is if you get word of mouth”\n\n(and the best test of word of mouth is exponential, organic growth)\n\n### On B2B Side\n\nEvery enterprise company should run a 30-day proof of concept trial. To make these trials productive, company’s usually require the customer to agree to buy the product after 30 days if it meets expectations. But… pull the trial after 30 days (no matter what). Then:\n\n“If the customer doesn’t scream, you don’t have product-market fit because if they’re not going to buy it at the end of 30 days, they’re not desperate, and if they’re not desperate, you don’t have product-market fit.”\n\n“The second biggest mistake I see entrepreneurs make, especially in enterprise, is when they pitch a potential customer on an idea, and when the customer doesn’t like the idea, they try to iterate on the product to build something the customer would want.” “That’s the absolutely wrong thing to do, even though it feels right. You want to find people who love what you’re doing, not try to convince the ‘no’s’ and turn them into ‘yes’s.'”\n\n“By the way, this is analogous to attracting a VC. If a VC doesn’t immediately say, ‘When can I meet you again?’ you haven’t found product-market fit”‘\n\nThat said: “You should iterate on the who and how, the business model”\n\n(Like how Netflix switched from a DVD rental-based model to a subscription model)\n\n**Sales yield**\n\nYou measure where exactly a company is in their sales life by calculating their sales yield (the contribution margin of a sales team divided by the total cost to field that sales team)\n\n“When a company gets to a sales yield >1, that’s how you know you’ve hit product-market fit”\n\n**Not Everyone Needs to Like Your Product**\n\nEntrepreneurship/investing can be described with a 2\xd72 matrix: On one dimension, you can be right or wrong; on the other dimension, you can be consensus or non-consensus\n\nIf you’re wrong, you don’t make money. But, and most don’t realize this, if you’re right and consensus, you also don’t make money (the returns get arbitraged away).\n\n“Unless you’re non-consensus, you don’t have a chance to serve the desperate (because they wouldn’t be desperate unless they were already served)”\n\n> “The only way to make outsized returns as an investor or entrepreneur is to be right and non-consensus”\n\n“If you ask 5 people on the street about your idea, and it might be a killer idea, at least 4 out 5 of them should say they don’t like it because they haven’t been conditioned to like it” If you asked people about Uber 10 years ago, 90% of them would have thought it was a dumb idea\n\n“You want people not to like your idea. If everyone likes the idea, it means they’ve already been conditioned, so you’re just trying to do a better job than someone else – that’s not a recipe for success in tech” – Andy Rachleff\n\n**Stages of Adoption**\n\n“The fundamental idea expressed in Crossing the Chasm is that there’s a natural rate of adoption of every product. This hasn’t changed. It was true 100 years ago, and it’ll be true in another 100 years.”\n\nAnother point discussed in the book: Certain people are willing to adopt at different rates:\n\n❍ A product is adopted by “early adopters”\n\n❍ These people tend to have a problem they need solved and want to buy a product to do just that\n\n❍ Next, come the “pragmatists”. They want something revolutionary, not evolutionary (they’re not trying to get ahead in their jobs, they’re trying not to get fired). These people tend only to buy if 5 other people tell them they should buy (they need social proof)\n\n❍ The next group, “the conservatives” or “late majority” only buy the product once it becomes the standard\n\nPragmatists make up the largest market segment, but it’s a mistake to go after them first, Why? – They need references.\n\n**On Pivots**\n\n> “The vast majority of successful tech companies pivoted from their original proposed market in their business plan”\n\n“You have to be willing to fail, but don’t pivot on the product. If you fix the market but pivot the product, then you have no advantage because your original insight is gone. What insight do you have over anyone else? You’re now in the “right and consensus” quadrant.” – Andy Rachleff\n\nThus: Keep your proprietary insight and find the right customer for that insight, rather than abandoning the insight.\n\n### Frameworks for heading towards PMF\n\nWhen talking to potential customers early on, here are the three things I’d look for to build confidence that you are heading towards PMF:\n\n1. **Passion:**\xa0How excited do people get when you describe your idea? You want to see people get visibly excited. You want them to ask you how soon this thing will exist. You want to hear them offer you money for it. This will be hard to miss. If you can’t find a handful of people that act this way, you either don’t have PMF, you aren’t pitching it well, or you haven’t talked to the right people. Adjust one or two of these things and see if you can get there. Try to find at least five people who are very excited. As Paul Graham famously said, “It's better to have 100 people that love you than a million people that just sort of like you.”\n\n2. **Skin in the game:**\xa0Are people willing to pay you for this product? Ask them this directly. Even try to get them to pay you now (i.e.. literally send them an invoice) to get early access to the product.\xa0*Nothing*\xa0will be a better signal of interest and PMF if you can do this successfully. Try this even if it’s a consumer app that you won’t charge for — it’ll show you how much value you’re creating in people’s lives.\n\n3. **A clear why:**\xa0As you talk with these potential users, keep asking “why.” Why are they excited about your product? What specifically is it going to do for them? Why is this problem a big deal? Why aren’t they using something else instead? This will both help you make sure you’re understanding what they are saying, and help you get to the core of their pain point.\n\nConcrete questions I’d ask in your interviews after you describe your idea:\n\n1. How are you currently solving this problem?\n\n2. What annoys you about your current approach?\n\n3. If you had a magic wand, what would you wish for to solve this problem?\n\n4. How much would you pay for this if it existed?\n\n5. Why is this a problem for you? \\[Listen for answer\\] Why is that? \\[Listen for answer\\] Why is that? \\[Listen for answer\\] Why is that?\n\nFinal tip: Pick the people you talk to carefully. Figuring out the target audience for your product is very much part of this search, so be careful getting discouraged by talking to the wrong group of people.",title:"Notes on PMF",date:new Date("2022-12-30T21:00:00.000Z"),summary:"Move too slow",cover:"/images/blog/ai.png",coverAlt:"A metallic rainbow artwork on a black background.",category:"notes",_meta:{filePath:"pmf.mdx",fileName:"pmf.mdx",directory:".",extension:"mdx",path:"pmf"},mdx:'var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var i=Object.defineProperty;var y=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var m=Object.getPrototypeOf,f=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var g=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(n,e)=>{for(var o in e)i(n,o,{get:e[o],enumerable:!0})},h=(n,e,o,a)=>{if(e&&typeof e=="object"||typeof e=="function")for(let r of p(e))!f.call(n,r)&&r!==o&&i(n,r,{get:()=>e[r],enumerable:!(a=y(e,r))||a.enumerable});return n};var b=(n,e,o)=>(o=n!=null?c(m(n)):{},h(e||!n||!n.__esModule?i(o,"default",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):o,n)),v=n=>h(i({},"__esModule",{value:!0}),n);var l=g((I,s)=>{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};w(k,{default:()=>u});var t=b(l());function d(n){let e={blockquote:"blockquote",em:"em",h3:"h3",h4:"h4",li:"li",ol:"ol",p:"p",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...n.components};return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:"Finding the product-market fit is not a deterministic process.

If we’ve talked in private, you’ve probably heard me bring it up: the difference between **feedback circles and hype circles**.\n\nMany venture-path founders and investors struggle to tell the difference between chasing short-term, trend-driven wins and uncovering (or creating) iconic, lasting companies. Too often, the motivation is just performative—impress each other, secure capital, boost perceived status. <mark>Hype is easy. Attention is cheap. It’s dangerously seductive to align with whatever VCs are tweeting about this week.</mark>\n\nBut here’s the uncomfortable truth: nobody builds a generational company by chasing hype. I don’t think it’s ever been done.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I’m dismissive of the hype-driven, bootstrapped AI app wave. Far from it. We’re in a golden era for small, fast, AI-native businesses. If you know how to wield the tools, move fast, and execute with precision, you can make real money—fast. I’ve seen solo builders or teams of fewer than five people generate $500K to $3M within 60 days. That’s incredible. I admire their taste and speed.\n\nBut when something works, it quickly becomes a playbook, a template. And playbooks invite saturation. The second-tier explainer threads show up. Then the YouTubers. Then the clones. Soon you’re in a race to the bottom. And with more FAANG talent now entering this space post-layoffs, competition is only going to intensify. Unless, you have strong network effect.\n\nIronically, many venture-path founders and VCs who claim they want to build iconic companies spend their time chasing these short-term trends. Because it feels safer. You don’t need to take a real bet. You just follow the momentum. You don’t need to be early. You don’t need to be right—just visible.\n\nBut when you look at how iconic companies are actually built, the story is different. The real outliers—the $500M to $5B+ outcomes—come from founders who sense long-term tides, not fleeting waves. They pursue ideas that aren’t immediately obvious.
