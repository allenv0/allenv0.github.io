10:T534,And it’s not that we can’t do our job without it, and we’re not defined by having experienced, we’re defined by the quality of people, the questions we ask. But it’s a nice thing to have in the room. Eric represents it, Sarah was at Pinterest for a long time, I think saw that. But we want to add more of that. So you tune it against that sort of core note of founder-level quality, which means they have to share culturally, this sort of sense of they’re serving entrepreneurs, they don’t want their name on the website. They don’t seek opportunities for a go at self expression. Because no question you could rationalize it. Well, if you’re doing that, it’s because you can draw attention to the companies. Yeah, maybe. There’s always some way to think about everything and analyte this kind to yourself. But that’s where we are. And I think we have an average age, right now, in the late 30s. It’s an interesting thing to think about. If we hadn’t done the work of the founders all firing themselves, our average age would be mid 50s—actually it’s not true, it would be early 60s, even with the current partners. And so the fact that we continue to rejuvenate and keep it in that essential core is I think, really, to me, the model propagates that way, because it’s destroying itself constantly.12:T624,At Thefacebook we started with American undergraduate schools. These all have the huge benefit of being small, clearly defined spaces, which made it possible for us to tip each one of them very quickly. In many cases it was literally a matter of hours from the time we opened a new school to the time when most people in that school were using the product actively. The specific things we had to do to make this work over and over again were deciding which schools to prioritize opening when; doing a lot of (unpaid!) offline and grassroots local guerrilla marketing; and collecting and bottling-up demand from schools we weren’t ready to launch yet then unleashing all of that pent-up demand at once when we were ready to launch a new school. Initially each school was its own island, and then once we had enough schools we started to link the schools together which lead to network effects both within and across schools. It’s worth noting that these early chapters at Facebook involved very little true “viral marketing” or “growth hacking” and the early growth at Thefacebook was more linear than exponential as a function of the limitations on who could sign up. I remember being surprised to see how few typical viral mechanisms were built into the product when I first started exploring it in 2004, even by the standards of that time. But those limitations on who could sign up and use Thefacebook were crucial to the core utility of the product for its early users, drove unprecedented engagement numbers, and set a fantastic foundation for the future.13:T55e,At LinkedIn we didn’t have the benefit of a small, clearly-defined initial surface area to go after at the start given the way the product has always worked, so we had to resort to - and in several cases invent - viral mechanisms for growth. In 2003 when LinkedIn launched (many people don’t realize that LinkedIn launched almost a year before Thefacebook!) the two primary distribution channels available to us were web search and email. LinkedIn profiles and content weren’t showing up meaningfully in search results so we couldn’t make much use of SEO. This was because we were very concerned about user privacy and control - in 2003 LinkedIn was actually the first service of any real size where people were putting their full first and last name on a user-generated profile online, and there were originally no pictures on user profiles by design. So email virality was the primary channel available to us for distribution. Like with all exponential functions there was a long initial tail on this viral growth, and Thefacebook actually reached 1,000,000 users much faster than LinkedIn despite not having virality engineered into the product. But once LinkedIn did tip it went from being a curiosity to a service with profound utility. It required a visionary entrepreneur, patient investors, and a team willing to run lots of scrappy experiments to get there.14:T417,SEO and email are still both good tools for distribution and growth today, but as the platform has shifted to mobile other things have become at least as important. There’s no unpaid mobile distribution platform which is as low-friction and easy as the SEO, email, the MySpace platform (through which YouTube grew) and the Facebook platform (through which Instagram and Pinterest grew) channels were in the Web 2.0 era. If anything this has raised the bar on the importance of finding a way to tip quickly into small networks or marketplaces then expand from there. Uber and Snapchat are both great examples of this: Uber started by focusing on black cars in San Francisco, making that market tip on both the demand and supply side, then launching additional city-level marketplaces from there; Snapchat started with a product that was immediately useful for people using it in a “network” of as few as 2 (or arguably even 1) person thanks to its initial focus on a new form of private communication and private sharing, and grew from there.15:T47e,, approach. I think it is a remarkable trait that is common between the very best people, be it Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey or Evan Spiegel. They are effective critical thinkers; they are constantly asking questions and listening to those. That drives their long-term success. As a potential investor, I find them interrogating me as much as I am interrogating them. Without being offensive, they will ask me questions like ‘What is it about our business that you like?’ or ‘Tell me why you think that is interesting?’ Beyond this, there comes a personality trait. I have been doing this job for 19 years and I ask this basic question ‘Would I want to work for that person?’ A lot of what we are doing is recruiting. There are a lot of people who tick the first two boxes of authenticity and fearsomeness, but for the lack of choice of words, I would say I find them unappealing to work with. We were lucky to spend time with Jeff Bezos, who is a big investor in our fund. As part of that, we get a dinner with him every year. Of course, there is a survivor bias, but these dimensions are crystal clear in great entrepreneurs like him.16:T459,In terms of specifics, I’ve learned that the one variable that defines a great relationship above all else is trust. I believe that comes from clarity of purpose, and shared-purpose. If there’s a “hidden agenda” it’s immediately obiovous to the subconscious mind, and it destroys trust. In a high trust relationship, I’ve found CEOs adapt and evolve at a higher positive rate. If there is one distinguishing trait in the best people I work with, they are learn-it-alls not know-it-alls. Another specific, I’ve also learned, as Peter Drucker said, where there are great peaks there are great valleys, and our job as a partner is to amplify the strengths and to recruit complements for the valleys. A final big lesson for me has been that motivation isn’t a fixed constant. Everyone will go though periods, which can last for months at a time, when they have lost faith or confidence in the potential of the business, and in those situations it’s essential as a partner to be a foundation of support and belief. It never ceases to amaze me how motivation can and almost always does return in full.17:T477,The the part that rhymes, if you want to call it that, is the lived reality of valuation resets. It’s been common across the cycle shifts, where public markets are wired up to be very nimble and agile and resets. Now, they still take six months time, sometimes they take longer, but broadly we’ve seen a catastrophic loss of value in the public tech stocks, 80% loss of value. That’s not happened in the private sector. How does it happen the private sector? Slowly, and because so much money got put into the balance sheets of the companies that could raise it in the last 18 months, many of them, and broadly, in our portfolio, in the ecosystem, that got to higher valuations, are buying time. And there’s a Maybe the market will recover by the time we need to get out there again. We’ll see. But that reset takes more time in the private market, and it can lead to these weird distortions of the practical consideration of Is my equity grant real? And I think it stresses companies to sort of face the music in a sense, to say, Okay, let’s know that we’re not our valuation today. You never are, it’s just a point in time…18:T46a,The analogy that people have used, which makes sense to me, is it’s more like cancer than the other flus that we’ve had. And in the venture business, I’ve seen two or three flus. One was very cute in 2008. It was a little more sustained than 2000 to 2004, maybe it’s 2001 to 2004. This is the cancer in the sense that it tends to compound towards negative, and it gets worse and worse and worse until it gets fixed through chemotherapy, which is called high interest rates. We could imagine, it’s not out of the realm of possibility, interest rates being above CPI to reset the economy. And that means what, 8, 9, 10% interest rates? Well, they were 20% in the 1980s. So if we get to that level, I think the question our companies don’t really have a point of view about is when the cost of capital goes up 3-5x, maybe 10x, is some sub segment of what we’re doing no longer economically viable? And that’s probably the case, if you believe that the inflation remedy is 12, 15% interest rates. We’re far away from that. And maybe it can course correct, maybe, but so this is where I think it’s really different.2:["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-base prose-zinc mx-auto dark:prose-invert md:prose-lg prose-h1:tracking-tight prose-a:text-blue-600 prose-a:no-underline hover:prose-a:underline prose-pre:bg-zinc-100 dark:prose-a:text-blue-400 dark:prose-pre:bg-zinc-900 lg:mx-0","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-balance text-2xl font-bold text-black dark:text-zinc-100","children":"Notes on Benchmark Capital"}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"$Ld"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"(2023)"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","em",null,{"children":"“Allen This is awesome — and includes a bunch of stuff we didn’t find!!!” - David Rosenthal, Acquired Podcast host"}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["In these notes, I focus ",["$","mark",null,{"children":"exclusively on insights from the general partners of a bygone era.
