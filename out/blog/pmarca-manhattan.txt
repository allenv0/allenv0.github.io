d:T61e,Marc: [00:48:15] You’d do it by process of elimination, work backwards, which is why did you need Apple to do the iPhone? Why wasn’t the iPhone a startup? There are a lot of big advances over the last 30 or 40 years. To your point, especially in these more complex fields and they come out of these big companies that entrepreneurs tend to be building the software. It goes back to this thing of, why do you have these large scale industrial conglomerates?
Why can’t you have more startups that are Tesla and SpaceX, is ultimately the question. Part of that is you read the story of Tesla and SpaceX and it’s the story of just a couple of things jump out at you. One is this story of just unbelievable drama, and stress, and risk. Elon almost lost both companies at different points multiple times. Very tenuous whether those companies could raise money at this point in time.
The classic venture backed financing model, you’re raising your round of money every two or three years, you need to assume you’re doing it with a new lead investor each time. If you need five, or six, or seven rounds of financing to get a complex product to market, but if you can’t raise that third or fourth round of financing, it’s game over, you lose the whole company.
So I would say this is a criticism of Silicon valley that I give a little bit of credence to, which is these big, hairy, audacious projects that involve lots of moving parts, they are just hard to do with the classic venture financing model because of this need to raise multiple rounds of capital.e:T474,What would be the alternative to that? What would be the counterfactual where you could have told Elon Musk up front, “We’re just going to pre-commit $5 billion to build Tesla or SpaceX.” By the way, oh, this is the other thing with Tesla and SpaceX, which is they’re the only examples. Why are there a hundred more Teslas and SpaceXes? Why are there not companies building automated machine factories building thousands of houses for a fraction of the cost of today? Or why are there not these huge new universities or robotic automated hospitals? All these things that the world pretty clearly needs, where are the startups to do those things?
Why do we only have Elon and why do we only have cars and rockets? And so it’s like, okay, well, what if you had a system in which you could pre-commit 5 billion and you could pre-commit 5billion and youcould pre−commit s5 billion to a project like Tesla, or SpaceX, or any of these other projects, and you were willing to do that because you knew that if the thing works, it would do what Tesla have SpaceX have done, which is you would generate equity value far in excess of that.2:["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-base prose-zinc mx-auto dark:prose-invert md:prose-lg prose-h1:tracking-tight prose-a:text-blue-600 prose-a:no-underline hover:prose-a:underline prose-pre:bg-zinc-100 dark:prose-a:text-blue-400 dark:prose-pre:bg-zinc-900 lg:mx-0","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-balance text-2xl font-bold text-black dark:text-zinc-100","children":"Marc Andreessen on On Investing in Immensely Complicated, Large-Scale Projects"}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"A Snippet Of: Marc Andreessen - Invest Like the Best (2021)"}],"\n",["$","h3",null,{"id":"investing-in-immensely-complicated-large-scale-projects","className":"relative w-fit","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"#investing-in-immensely-complicated-large-scale-projects","className":"absolute ml-[-1em] h-full w-[calc(100%+1em)] no-underline before:inline-block before:scale-90 before:text-zinc-400 before:opacity-0 before:transition before:content-['#'] hover:before:scale-100 hover:before:opacity-100 before:dark:text-zinc-600","aria-hidden":true}],"Investing in Immensely Complicated, Large-Scale Projects"]}],"\n",["$","h4",null,{"id":"004751-thinking-back-to-this-idea-of-factor-productivity-growth-and-the-idea-of-just-really-complicated-projects-your-partner-alex-had-a-great-suggestion-which-was-to-ask-you-how-you-think-about-financing-things-that-are-very-complex-the-specific-from-he-recommended-which-i-love-is-what-would-a-series-a-round-into-the-manhattan-project-have-looked-like-how-do-you-think-about-this-financing-of-very-complex-and-therefore-meaningful-and-worthwhile-projects","className":"relative w-fit","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"#004751-thinking-back-to-this-idea-of-factor-productivity-growth-and-the-idea-of-just-really-complicated-projects-your-partner-alex-had-a-great-suggestion-which-was-to-ask-you-how-you-think-about-financing-things-that-are-very-complex-the-specific-from-he-recommended-which-i-love-is-what-would-a-series-a-round-into-the-manhattan-project-have-looked-like-how-do-you-think-about-this-financing-of-very-complex-and-therefore-meaningful-and-worthwhile-projects","className":"absolute ml-[-1em] h-full w-[calc(100%+1em)] no-underline before:inline-block before:scale-90 before:text-zinc-400 before:opacity-0 before:transition before:content-['#'] hover:before:scale-100 hover:before:opacity-100 before:dark:text-zinc-600","aria-hidden":true}],"[00:47:51] Thinking back to this idea of factor productivity growth and the idea of just really complicated projects, your partner, Alex, had a great suggestion, which was to ask you how you think about financing things that are very complex.
